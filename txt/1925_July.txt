MOTOR ABILITY TESTS

Abstracts of a paper by Frederick W. Maroney, M. D. Atlantic City, N. J. Read at the Eastern District Convention of the Am. Physical Education Assn., Rochester, N. Y. April 4, 1925

The subject of Athletic Tests is not new. In fact, the present day Journals of Education vie with each other in the recording of tests and measurements. No longer are we satisfied with the pupils’ answers as to dates, problems, solutions, equations, knowledge of formulas and rules of syntax. The psycologic laboratory workers have compiled intelligence tests in practically all of the school subjects. In fact the stimulus given to mental tests by the psychologists during the period of the Selective Service Draft work has resulted in a nation-wide interest.

For many years we have worked with athletic tests and measurements. These have been based upon the records of skilled performers, picked men; men who were favored with expert coach,

ing; men whose records were made in competition under favorable conditions. Then, too, we have used athletic tests based upon height, weight, age and grade. Much good has resulted in this type of test. It may be said in passing, that an enthusiastic teacher who really believes in the thing he is doing, can secure interest in and derive much good from any type of test he elects. Recently the test devised by the late Dr. Sargent has been given wide usage and with it we are invited to consider “A Test of Physical Efficiency:	The	Correlation	Between	Results	Therefrom

And Results From Tests of Mental Efficiency” by Schwegler and Enjglehardt of the University of Kansas. Dr. Barrow of Stanford University proposes a new General Athletic Ability Test. Collins and Howe of Wellesley College write on the subject of “A Preliminary Selection of Tests of Fitness.”

And so it goes. We have laid aside the German System vs. the Swedish System question; we have for the time being decided on a truce with our friends who, never having actually felt the thrill which comes from doing or seeing performed an exacting piece of calisthenic or apparatus work, tell us that an informal program of physical education will solve all of our troubles. Yes! we have even permitted the subjects of Mass Athletics and Athletics for Women, important as they are, to remain quiescent as we rush into the new thing in Physical Education.

Tests and Measurements, more Tests and Measurements. Personally, I believe in the test movement but only in so far as it challenges the interest of our pupils; holds them to higher goals of achievement and grips them with that something which will mean a carrying over of the exercise urge or incentive into after-school life.

The December 1924 edition of the American Physical Education Association Review contains a Report of The National Committee appointed by President Carl Schrader to study and report on the subject of Motor Ability Tests.

The Committee recommended eight groups of activities:—

1.	Free exercises (without use of hand apparatus.)

2.	Calisthenics (with use of hand apparatus).

3.	Marching.

4.	Dancing.

5.	Track and field athletics.

6.	Team game activities.

7.	Apparatus exercises and tumbling.

8.	Swimming.

Dr. McCurdy and I were detailed as a Sub-Committee to work out the subject of Free Exercises. We went ahead under the assumption that balance, posture and body control are essential to success in the physical life of an individual.

The Calisthenic or Free Exercises part of the Motor Ability Tests, to conform to the “success or failure” basig of the plan in general, consists primarily in balance positions on one or both feet; with or without arm positions, and trunk positions; with

jumps or hope preceding or following the balance and with or without the eyes open or shut.

As a member of the committee and as one interested in the Motor Ability Tests, I felt it incumbent upon me to try the tests with selected groups of pupils and the following is a report of same. The general conditions under which the tests were given:— The tests were given under regular class insirujtiosi coriaitioiia. They were explained to the teachers, and the pupils, demonstrated by the Physical Training supervisors, marked and passed upon by the teacher and the Physical Training supervisor. In order that time might be saved, and this report prepared, the four tests, October, December, February, and April, were given once a week until a representative number of pupils had been tested.

Free Exercises

Note 1. A pupil passes the test if he holds his balance for 15 seconds, that is, if he does not move his foot or feet during the time of the test.

Note 11. In exercises with the eyes closed, the eyes should be closed before the exercise begins.

General Conclusions

We did not try to prove any point in making the tests. Naturally, we believed that the pupils who had had the benefit of directed Physical Traiaing over a number of sfchool yearst would stand higher in the tests, than those pupils who came to us from school systems not supporting a Physical Training program. We were interested in a comparison between the pupils of sub-normal intelligence, that is the so-called feeble-minded or Binet class pupils, with normal children of the same school grade. Our tests proved very conclusively that the sub-normal children were distinctly below the pupils of normal grade level in the tests. Also, the span of attention and the interest taken ita the test was greater in the normal grades than it was with the children of the sub-normal groups.

An interesting, if not valuable part of the test, showed that the gjirls and boys of the Vocational Schools ranked materially lower than the pupils of the same grades in the regular schpol activities.

The High School girls and boys were given the four tests early in December 1924, and these tests were repeated with the same groups late in March 1925. The interest was keen. The pupils tried to better their standards as shown by the examinations. The results they attained seemed to prove that regular Physical Education work in an all-around program, plus the interest which was aroused by the teachers in the tests was responsible for this increased ability.

We recognize that there is a danger in the acceptance of tests and measurements for regular lesson activities. An enthusiast, not grounded in thfe importance of regular lesson activities, may be tempted to use the lesson time for testing, chart making, and the drawing of conclusions which do not always prove the case.

There should be a word of caution given to all young teachers in the application of tests and measurements to their Physical Training work.

The Motor Ability Tests in Free Exercises are not of necessity the last word in this type of test activity. Each work needs • to be done, and there is a field of investigation for all of up.

I believe tests are fundamentally sound. They should be included in good Physical Training Programs, not to measure the teacher’s ability in teaching, but rather because of their value in arousing in the pupils an appreciation of physical responsibility and a realization of the possibilities of increasing motor skill through a general program which includes specific measurable activities.

A STUDY OF AWARDS IN CERTAIN SECONDARY

SCHOOLS*

By J. Albert Blackburn, Friends’ Central School, Philadelphia, Pa.

The investigation described below was undertaken as the first step in an inquiry into the relation of prizes and awards to the attainment of the objectives of secondary education.

A preliminary search for literature on the subject revealed nothihg on methods of granting awards and but little on the general subject of awards. Accordingly the writer set out to collect information on the subject from principals and teachers associated with him in graduate study of secondary education. Twenty teachers volunteered to furnish the data from their respective schools and to assist in its classification and interpretation. The following table shows the frequency distribution of the information thus collected and interpreted.

Schools No. 1, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 are coeducational public high schools in Pennsylvania towns.

School No. 2 is a coeducational public high school in rural Delaware.

School No. 5 is a coeducational public high school in a small town in Virginia.

School No. 7 is a private boarding school for girls under religious direction.

School No. 8 is a coeducational public high school in a Vermont town.

School No. 9 is a coeducational private six-year secondary day school.

Schools No. 10 and 14 are coeducational public high schools in New Jersey towns.

School No. 16 is a coeducational public high school in rural Pennsylvania.

School No. 18 is a boy’s public technical high school in an industrial city of Pennsylvania.

School No. 20 is a girls’ public high school of Philadelphia.

Columns No. 2 and No. 3 explain themselves. The coefficient of correlation between the two is plus .33.

Column No. 4 describes the nature of the awards; thus in school No. 1 five insignia and one trophy comprize the six awards of this school shown by Column 3.

“Insignia” here includes mementos meant to be displayed on the person of the recipient; school letter, numerals, sweater with letter or numerals, medals, gold or silver, football, basketball and base ball charm, gold, silver, and brotaze pins.

“Money” ranged ijn value from $1.00 to $75.00 with $10.00 mentioned most often.

“Trophies” represents such awards as cups, silver dishes, fountain pens, books, and engraved certificates.

“Scholarships” is here used in its commonly accepted meaning.

“Honors” includes membership in honor society, honor positions on commencement program, and yearly (but not monthly) honor roll.

Column No. 5. shows the number of awards given in the various schools by each of the five classes of donors. These five classes are clearly defined in the column headings. Thus in School No. 4 four awards are given by the school, three by local agencies, and one by a higher educational institution.

vLocal Agency” includes clubs, lodges, industrial corporations, and home and school associations.

Column 6 indicates the distribution of awards with respect to the bases on which the awards were made. The facts sought in this column resisted tabulation more than any other class of information throughout the study. Conditions of awards and frequently stated in such terms as: “Good Citizenship”, Scholar-

ship, Moral Conduct, Willingness to Work, Attitude, etc., or Scholarship, Physical Fitness, Participation in Out door Activities, Character, Intellectual Promise.

After much consideration the classification shown in the column was determined upon.

“Subject Excellence’’ refers to conditions expressed as “excellence in Mathematics’’ as distinct from general scholarship which ref ere to scholarship level or rank in school records.

“Physical Attainment” is clear.

“Participation in Activities not Physical” explains itself.

“Character” in this table represents the following elements: personality, influence for good, leadership, service, loyalty, honor, courage.

“Economic Need” is a condition mentioned in several schools.

The fractional entries are the result of more than one element within the column applying in a given school to a particular award. The fractional entries here used involve too great an assumption for accuracy, though the writer felt that results so expressed were more nearly accurate than if expressed in integers. In school No. 9 for example, the table shows that 2.3 awards are made for General Scholarship, .8 awards for Participation in Activities not Physical, and 1,9 awards for Character. The actual facts are that in addition to the two awards on a basis of Subject Excellence and the one on Physical Attainment, there are three awards in which General Scholarship is a part of the basis and one in which Participation in Activities is a part of the basis, and two in which Character enters as a portion of the basis. These facts in addition to being difficult to tabulate, do not tell the whole story since they do not indicate to what extent each element entered the basis on which the award was given. In forming .the table, then, if two elements entered in the basis for the award each was given a value of .5, if three entered, the first named was given a value of .4 and each of the other two a value of .3.

At the bottom of the table are shown the total and the per cent total of each of the various elements.

Conclusions.

In so far as the results obtained as described above are reliable and representative, the table and the following facts taken from it, though not shown explicitly by it, seem to form the conclusions.

1.	There is but little relation between the number of awards and the size of the school, (Coefficient of corelation equals plus .33)

2.	Secondary school awards predominantly consist of insignia given by the school to one student chosen by

the faculty on the basis of general scholarship: that the school keeps record and the awards are presented on commencement day. This statement takes into account only the answers to greatest frequency as shown in Table 1. (See frequency total and per cent total at bottom of table.)

3.	‘ While the faculty (as a whole or in groups) chose the recipient in 69 per cent of awards, the student voice is heard in 14.9 per cent.

4.	The recipients of awards are chosen in 16.1 per cent of the cases by persons not connected with the school organization.

5.	Scholarship general and specific, is the basis of 52 per cent of all awards.

6.	Participation in non academic phases of school life is the basis for the granting of 34 per cent of awards.

MAINTAINING INTEREST IN THE GYMNASIUM

George J. Altmann, Indianapolis.

The organization described here has been found very effective in maintaining interest in the physical education classes of the boys at Manual Training High School. Activities which threaten to become monotonous because of repetition, take on a new interest; boys who have been indifferent to or even disliked certain activities develop interest and even enthusiasm through the team organization and competition. Co-operation, subordination, fair play and other desirable qualities also result from the group consciousness.

The simplicity and ease of operating the score sheet appea to both instructor and pupil.

The Organization.

A Red and a White team are formed in each class.

The members of the teams elect their Captains and Lieutenants, these officers serving as team and squad leaders.

Scoring:

Every day two or three activities are scored, one point being awarded to the winning team. The score sheet is posted on the bulletin board, the total score being published each week, or oftener.

Attendance:

One point awarded to the team with the larger number appearing properly dressed—Officers report the number to the instructor.

Marching:

Teams march separately—One point awarded to team making best impression on instructor.

Runnings: As for marching.

“OVER THE TOP”

E.	Marion Roberts, Brookston, Mass.

At the time of the world war a game developed in boys' gymnasium of the Brockton High School, which the boys named “Over the Top.” This game is so simple in its structure and method of play that it can be used in any type of gymnasium, and at the same time it combines so thoroughly the elements of attack and defense that it has become the most popular part of our gymnasium program. Our boys would rather play it than do any other thing which our gymnasium offers. While combining the best elements of physical and mental exercise and Tecreation, our rules have been so developed that every boy is put on his honor in playing the game, which has made it a remarkable aid in the development of good sportsmanship.

The game is played with four (four pound) medicine balls, and the gymnasium floor is blocked off into three spaces—See diagram. The distance from line number one to the end wall of the gymnasium should be from 18 to 22 feet, and from line number two to the opposite end wall, an equal distance. The space between line number one and line number two will be the remainder of the gymnasium floor and will vary according to the size thereof. The class is divided into two teams, and any number of boys may place on each team.

Team number one lines up behind line number one—team number two behind line number two. Two boys from each team place the medicine balls on their respective lines at either side of the floor. The command is given, "Ready; Play.” No member of either team may touch the medicine ball on the floor until the word “Play” is given. The object of the game is to hit some player on the opposite team with the ball on the fly. Any player so hit must withdraw from the game on his own responsibility; that is, the instructor does not referee the game, but every boy is put on his own honor to get out when hit.

The ball cannot be caught in the air by a player. If he does so he is hit and must leave the game. If a player is hit by a ball on the bounce or on a rebound from the wall or balcony or apparatus, or if a ball has hit another player first, it does not constitute a hit and the player remains in the game.

The players of team number one may advance all the way to line number two with the ball, but may not step over line number two. If they inadvertently step over line number two they must leave the game. The same is true of players on team number two, who may advance to line number one. Thus a safety zone behind line number one exists for team number one and a similar zone behind line number two

Google
639

for team number two. The space between line one and line two is “No man’s land” where all sorts of opportunity for clever dodging and throwing will develop.

When all but two of the players on one side have been eliminated, in order to speed up the completion of the game and thus start a new game, we have two players from each side start with the balls as in the beginning of the game. These two, now, are permitted to go anywhere on the floor until all players on one team have been eliminated.

We find that a class will play an average of three games per period of 45 minutes, and that every boy gets a thorough work-out during that time. A boy may be the first one eliminated in the first game, and stay in until near the last in the other games.

The fact that four balls are in play all the time requires a great deal of alertmess in keeping track of where these balls are, and the dodging and throwing give the boys plenty of exercise. A ball of this weight can be thrown at considerable speed and with enough force so that there is an element of danger in the game, which appeals tremendously to the boy. At the same time we have played the game here for about eight years without a serious injury.

It would be well in playing this game to remove all breakable apparatus from the ends of the floor. The windows, if there are any at either end, should be thoroughly protected with heavy iron grating, otherwise there will be considerable breakage from the force of the balls.

We believe that this game is the most valuable we have seen for the development of good sportsmanship, taking punishment with a smile, for all around physical development, and at the same time for developing quick thinking and mental alertness.

PUBLIC RECREATION—A TWENTIETH CENTURY

PRODUCT

The cities of America which provide space and leadership for the play of their people have grown from fourteen or less, at the beginning of 1900 to 711, at the beginning of 1925. This quarter century has marked the acceptance of public play as a department of municipal government and a new civic science. Cities first opened children’s playgrounds as a philanthropic experiment. Today a community’s provision for the recreation of its citizens, young and old, is an important index of its progress and its livableness, says the 1924 Year Book of the Playground and Recreation Association of America.

The annual increases in the funds spent by cities for public recreation are an effective record of the progress of the movement. This record goes back to 1907, the year after the Association was organized. Slightly less than one million dollars

was reported spent in 1907. Expenditures have thereafter shown a definite upward curve, though during a few years, they have fallen below the mark of the previous year. The greatest fluctuations were during the war period, from 1913 to 1918, when there was a drop of about three-quarters of a million dollars. In 1918, steady annual increase began. The 1924 expenditure was reported at $20,052,558. The gain from 1922 through 1924, a matter of nearly eleven millions, is more than the gain from the beginning of the play movement up to 1922, when $9,317,048 was reported.

Eight thousand, one hundred and fifteen refreshing centers of public play are now scattered through America, according to the 1924 reports. These recreation areas include outdoor playgrounds, indoor recreation centers and athletic fields of various types. Six hundred and thirty-five of them were opened for the first time in 1924.

Especially encouraging is the increase in leadership, the factor all-important to the success of a public recreation program. During 1924, 15,871 workers were employed, 2,783 of them the year round. This is an increase of 3,589 over the workers reported for 1923.

America got into the game during 1924 with 33,051 teams of amateur athletes and 17,492,751 spectators at public sports, the Year Book shows. These statistics cover ten sports,— baseball, football, soccer, basketball, volley ball, dodge ball, kitten ball, playground ball, quoits and bowling, as promoted under leadership by public recreation agencies. The ratio of players to onlookers indicates that public recreation is dealing a telling blow to that national menace which has been dubbed “spectatoritis.” More and more Americans are getting their recreation at first hand instead of watching others play.

The municipal vacation is a new development. Eighty-three cities now maintain 123 summer camps, some for boys and girls, some where entire families may enjoy healthful diversion at a nominal charge. Bathing beaches and other places for water sports were reported by 2l5 cities and totaled 458. In ddition, 272 cities reported 626 public swimming pools.

Cities are regarding their expenditures for public recreation as an investment, says the Year Book. They are finding that municipal play reduces street accidents to children, improves health, lessens crime and delinquency, and both attracts and holds residents and industries. Though the public recreation movement has gathered considerable momentum, the need for pioneer work with towns and cities is still urgent and widespread. Behind the movement is the Playground and Recreation Association of America. Last year the Association, through the visits of its field workers, gave significant aid to 318 cities and, through its correspondence service, answered 19,000 inquiries.

HELPS IN THE FORMATION OF HEALTH HABITS

By Wn>. A. Stecher.

For many years Health'Day has been celebrated in Philadelphia during the first' week in May. A small committee consisting of influential citizens has guided the development of this day so that practical results should accrue. New methods of approach and attack were gradually introduced, that would bring the message of fundamental health facts before such members of the community who, through poverty or through unfamiliarity with the results of modern discoveries, needed en-lightment.

The schools, naturally, always have been one of the means used by the committee. Last fall, after some discussion, it was decided to branch out into a different kind of enlightenment, or rather into a different method of approach. It was thought wise to make a definite effort to interest that most impressionable group, the Junior High School pupils, in the formation of definite health habits, by means of a new plan that is described later.

Several conferences then led to the formulation of definite principles that should underlie a plan to win these adolescents over to a constructive plan for health education. Then Dr. James M. Anders, who for many years has been chairman of the Public Health Day Committee, decided to donate a bronze trophy that annually should be presented to the Junior High School that during the school year did most among its pupils to promote the health habits included in the plan. Next, Dr. R. Tait McKenzie was commissioned to design a suitable trophy emblematic of health.

After the plan had been approved by the superintendent t of schools, a letter was sent to each of the 12 Junior High Schools containing the following information:

“To Principals of Junior High Schools:

The Public Health Day Committee, Dr. James M. Anders, Chairman, has donated to the public schools a “Health Trophy” to be competed for annually by the Junior High Schools. Dr. R. Tait McKenzie has been commissioned to model a bronze bas-relief for the trophy. This is to be presented annually on Health Education Day to that Junior High School that during the year does most to promote health habits among its pupils.

The factors for awarding this trophy for this school year are as follows:

I. Physical vigor of pupils. (Weight—50 points)

This is to be determined by the percentage of pupils passing the jumping, throwing, running, and apparatus aims. Team captains will be asked to enter the summary at the bottom of the captain sheet; number of pupils on Dt^ajm (fi^i^tjer[£>f over-
642

weight and underweight pupils, number failing in the jump, throw, dash and apparatus; personal hygiene, games.

II. Correction of remedial physical defects.	(Weight—

20 points)

The record of a school in “Proportion of Physical Defects Corrected” as determined by the Division of Medical inspection shall be taken for this factor.

III.	Health Habits (Weight—30 points) divided as follows:

A.	Proper weight for age, type and height. (Weight—

10)

This factor is to be determined by the use of the age, • type, height, weight charts of the Division of Physical Education. Every overweight and underweight pupil is to be starred (*) when the team pupils are first weighed. Pupils should weigh themselves frequently and if the proper weight is reached before the end of the term the star (*) is removed.

B.	Cleanliness. (Weight—20) subdivided as follows:

1.	Of pupils. (Weight—10)

The percentage of pupils passing in personal hygiene shall determine this factor.

2.	Of building. (Weight—10) Note:	Only those con-

ditions for which the pupils are obviously responsible are iaj be considered.

A committee of three supervisors will make a sanitary inspection once a term using the following scale for rating the schools:

a.	Toilets, washrooms, shower baths, drinking fountains (4 points)

b.	Lunch rooms (3)

c.	Gymnasiums and play yard (1)

d.	Hallways and locker rooms (1)

e.	Classrooms (1)

Results. On account of the newness of the plan and because of changes of teachers, etc., not all schools were able to turn in complete reports for each term. The committee, therefore, decided to place the twelve schools in two groups, the schools in Group A having complete records covering a full school year and those in Group B having incomplete records. The weight given to the different items for the B group differs from that used for the A group.

The standing of the schools in the two groups was as follows:

Group A.

Jay Cooke...............................................82.6	points

Edwin H. Vare...........................................80.4	points

George C. Thomas........................................80.0	points

Oliver Wendall Holmes...................................77.7	points

Anna Howard Shaw........................................74.5	points

John B. Stetson.........................................71.0	points

William T. Tilden...............................   v„j..70.1	points

Group B.

Mayer Sulzberger.................................  83.8	points

John Paul Jones..................................  81.0	points

Theodore Roosevelt..............................   80.0	points

Warren G. Harding..............................    75.8	points

Roxborough ....................................... 72.5	points

The trophy was therefore awarded to the Jay Cooke School for the year 1925. As each Junior High School has from 1500 to 20000 pupils, the plan affects approximately 20,000 boys and girls.

The Health Education Trophy is a wood plaque measuring two by three feet. The figure is in bronze, in bas relief, on circular base eighteen inches in diameter; it is called Radiance. As as expression of radiant helth, it is modelled in his best manner by Dr. McKenzie, showing a youthful girl in a pose expressing vigor and health.

DEFECTIVE EYES IN SCHOOLS AND INDUSTRY

By Guy A. Henry, New York.

For ages baffling computation the human race lived out of doors—it is only within a comparatively recent period that man came indoors. For countless centuries man roamed the fields and hunted the forests and, relatively, it was only a little while ago that he began to settle down and till the ground and live in communities. It was only yesterday, as it were, that he adopted the confinement of residences, the close application of educational systems, artificial lighting and the many exacting and restricting influences, common to this the twentieth century.

Untold ages were required to develop the human eye—an evolvement suited for out-door use—suddenly we demand of it the close application common to the necessities of modem life.

Writing was not developed until a few hundred years before the Christian Era; printing many centuries later and it was not until the middle of the fifteenth century that the first book was printed. The crude screw hand printing press received no considerable improvement until the nineteenth century.

Most of us would have to go back but a few generations to find ancestors who could neither read or write.

Consider to what an increased extent we are using our eyes for near work under modem conditions compared with a generation or so ago—the requirements of modem educational methods and the demands of vocational, industrial, commercial and professional pursuits. Reading is indulged in to a much greater extent than was the practice a few years ago.

The modem art of illumination contributes greatly to the use of our eyes especially for near work for there was not the incentive to read by the flickering candle flame or the com-

paratively weak light of the oil lamp that there is with the improved lighting facilities of today.

Within the past 50 years there has been more development in lighting than in all the ages past. This great increase in artificial lighting has brought an additional burden which the human eye has not quickly learned to carry. Is it strange that most of us have defective eyes and that there is need for Conservation of Vision?

Most of our eye troubles have their beginning in youth and it is during childhood that eye care should be taught and practiced especially since uncorrected eye defects increase steadily with age.

It is not a simple matter to detect the existence of visual defects, especially in children, for frequently high errors are not revealed by vision below the normal. It is for this reason that there is uncertainty as to the actual proportion of school children that need correction; another reason will be referred to later.

To arrive at a reasonably definite conclusion as to the true average conditions of school children’s eyes, there would be required the thorough examination of a very large group or, better, several large groups. This would mean the services of highly skilled professional men and such an undertaking would require much time and be costly.

There is available, however, very valuable data, most of which is based upon quite simple tests as conducted in schools by teachers and nurses. The purpose of this test is to determine the visual perception of the pupils by having them read, with each eye separately, letters of certain standard sizes at the proper distance.

This test, if properly conducted, will show whether or not the visual acuity is normal and so detect those cases with defects which have caused reduced visual perception. These are called manifest defects. The concealed or latent defects are not revealed, but careful observation on the part of those making these tests may detect other symptoms of eyestrain such as complaints of headache, squinting, frowning, styes, sensitiveness to the light, etc.

This procedure will reveal the worst cases and experience has clearly established that such tests may be carried out advantageously by the teachers.

It is important, however, that these tests be made carefully and under the proper conditions so that incorrect records do not result. A nation-wide survey of eye care in education and industry recently completed by the Eye Sight Conservation Council showed wide differences in the results of tests in different schools which indicate that in many schools the tests are made very superficially and that a uniform procedure is not observed in making the tests.

From tests of 483,154 school children in 19 cities, the reported percentages of total eye defects, corrected and uncorrect-

ed, varied all the way from 3.5 percent to 58 percent and averaged 21.9 percent.

A city in New Jersey reported 3.5 percent of its school children with corrected and uncorrected eye defects, a city in Missouri 7 percent and a city in New Hampshire 6.7 percent. At the other extreme, a city in New York reported 40 percent, a city in Louisiana 50 percent and a city in Maine as high as 58 percent.

Obviously, something is wrong with such findings for such discrepancies cannot exist. Poorly conducted tests are of little value and their results misleading.

These simple visual acuity tests where properly conducted reveal that approximately 25 percent of school children have manifest defects of vision (corrected and uncorrected) and other sym-toms of eyestrain, which hamper materially their school work.

If thorough examinations were made by competent professional men skilled in refraction work the cases with hidden or latent errors would also be detected and the results would show an accurate indication of the prevalence of visual defects.

Unfortunately, there is not available much data based upon thorough examinations of large groups of school children. There is on record the findings of very careful examinations of a number of children in the schools of an Eastern city. This study was made bjr a committee of competent authorities and relative to the findings the chairman of that committee stated:

“There were 88.11 percent of hypermetropic (far-sighted) eyes, which leaves for all other states of refraction at an average age of eight and one-half years, 11.89 percent of which 4.27 per cent were near-sighted, leaving only 7.51 percent for normal eyes. A careful analysis of these statistics shows that of these defective eyes, i. e. eyes with errors of refraction, that in upwards of 66 percent of them, the defect was high enough to cause trouble, and therefore, they needed glasses to wear. Theoretically, a.11 of these defective eyes would have been better for glasses, but practically at least 66 percent of them required them for their comfort and safety.”

The conclusions reached through this study covering a painstaking examination of a large group of school children indicated that less than 10 percent of children at the average age of eight and one-half years have normal eyes and that more than 60 per cent have errors of a sufficient degree to warrant correction. These findings have been extensively quoted being regarded as authentic and scientifically correct.

It will be noted that while a truly normal eye is rare there are many slight errors that are not of sufficient degree to cause trouble.

It is an interesting fact that those who have defects of low degree are the ones who invariably suffer from headaches and the various nervous disturbances resulting from eyestrain, because the eye muscles can exert enough effort to overcome the small errors whereas large errors cannot be overcome and frequently do not cause discomfort, but merely poor vision.

A small error in the eyes of a healthy, robust child may produce no ill effect whatever and the need of glasses be very questionable, while the same minor error in an under nourished, weak or nervous child may cause headaches and be detrimental to health if not corrected.

To what extent these small errors should be corrected, unless accompanied by headaches or other symptoms, is a question in the minds of some authorities and this is another reason why it is difficult to state positively what proportion of school children do have errors which should be corrected.

Unquestionably, a large proportion of school children are contending with eye defects of sufficient degree to cause trouble although many of these errors are not indicated by vision below normal, and until thorough eye examinations by experts are made of groups whereby a large cross section is obtainable, any percentage applicable to the country as a whole should be stated conservatively.

The results of the survey conducted by the Council indicate an t increase in the prevalence of defective vision among university students. Twenty-two colleges and universities reported 42,275 students examined with the prevalence of defective vision varying from 15.6 percent to 51 percent and averaging 37.7 per cent. These conclusions were all based on simple visual acuity tests which were probably conducted more carefully and thoroughly than similar tests made in graded schools. These figures pertained principally to entering students. It is safe to assume that this prevalence of defective vision among those students at the beginning of their university studies was undoubtedly greater than prevailed with these same students in their younger years. Unquestionably, close application in preparatory schools accentuated the defects.

The demands of school work and the existence generally of unsatisfactory school and home lighting cause a gradual increase of visual defects resulting in higher percentages of prevalence, thus our young men and women go into the business world handicapped in many instances by defective eyes.

Here again are found exacting visual demands in almost every line of gainful occupation with illumination frequently as bad as in the home and the school.

The results of visual acuity tests conducted in industry similar to the tests in schools, also show a marked variation. Data on eye examinations, eye protection and lighting has been gathered by the Eye Sight Conservation Council in a nationwide survey from 170 companies located in 23 states and employing over one million persons. It was found that most of these companies paid little or no attention to the eye condition of employees. From the records of seven companies which did, employing eight thousand or more each, it was learned that a total of 136,630 employees given eye tests showed a prevalence of defective vision ranging from 48.3 percent to 71.3 percent and averaging 53.6 percent.

Google
647

These tests were made of applicants for employment and consisted of the simplest kind of test for detecting manifest defects. More thorough tests reported by seven other companies in this same investigation showed an average of 72 per cent based upon 12,795 examinations. A sufficient number of careful investigations have been made of large groups of employees in industrial and commercial establishments to warrant the statement that fully 66 percent of the gainfully employed in the United States have defective vision.

The results of this investigation are far reaching. These two groups, our school children and the gainfully employed in industry, represent almost 2-3 of our population.

It was further brought out that there were less than 17 percent of the 24 million children enrolled in the public schools of the United States in 1923 which were given even the simple visual acuity test and there are probably not more than one hundred or one hundred and fifty companies in the United States employing a thousand persons or over who consider it essential to test the eyes of applicants for employment and still fewer companies which conduct such tests periodically for their employees.

While the conduction of eye tests to determine visual acuity is a comparatively simple procedure it is apparent from the discrepancies in reports that more care should be exercised by those making these tests. Technical knowledge is not required but certain important details must be observed. Concise instructions for making such tests have been prepared by the Eye Sight Conservation Council, Times Building, New York City and will be sent to any teacher or employer. If. these instructions are followed with reasonable care there will be detected those whose keenness of vision is below normal and there will not be such unreasonable variances as have been reported in the past.

Our public schools are turning out thousands of youths each year who seek jobs at the employment offices of factories and business establishments. Educational authorities are not meeting their responsibility of properly caring for the eyes of this vast number of persons before they reach the age of employment.

Existing conditions place an unnecessary burden upon industry, retard production and inflict needless suffering upon humanity.

In industry those employers who recognize their responsibility in this field not only realize inestimable benefits but also contribute to the physical upbuilding and betterment of society.

Remediable measures such as the correction of visual defects, safety measures for the protection of eyes from hazards and accidents, and improvements in lighting conditions, produce results which no company can afford to overlook.

The solution of the difficulty lies first in our schools, a duty resting directly upon our educational authorities and sec-

ond it involves an economic question with which management in industry is charged.

Mothers and teachers, especially, should be vigilant in safeguarding the eyes of infants ana children, shielding them from injurious light and against use under improper conditions. It is frequently in the earlier years of life during the period of development that eye troubles have their start. Early co-rection and protection are most important, for if .the eyes of youth are cared for, the eyes of maturity and old. age will be stronger and brighter and better and coming generations will be free from many discomforts which are now so common.

A PROGRESSIVE COURSE IN HYGIENE

Clinton S. Leonard, Scarsdale, N. Y.

According to the outline in the New York State Physical Training syllabus, there should be at least two periods weekly of ten or fifteen minutes each devoted to the instruction of hygiene, this instruction to be coordinated with or to include the instruction already given in physiology or hygiene.

In the attempt to fulfill this requirement, the administration of the Scarsdale High School originally planned the school program to include two fifteen minute gatherings of two groups each week. One group included all the Junior high school pupils, while the other was composed of all the Senior high school pupils.

It was soon found that this scheme had several disadvantages. In the first place, the groups were tremendously large, with their consequent problems of tardiness and discipline. In the second place, repetition seemed unavoidable as there could be no progressive course of study. With all the classes together there was no differentiating of work. This meant that each freshman must face three years of more or less of duplication of material. Another disadvantage, each period was too short to enable adequate discussion of any subject.

Realizing the inefficiency of this system and looking forward to a broader program that might include sex hygiene-, the principal of the school with the physical department rearranged the school program so that every two weeks a regular school period of forty-five minutes could be devoted to hygiene instruction for each separate class. In each case, the girls were to meet with a woman physical instructor, and the boys with a male instructor.

This new schedule permitted a progressive course of hygiene and physiology throughout the entire school. As a Regents’ course in physiology or human biology is required in the freshman year at Scarsdale, this was used as the nucleus around which the rest of the program was built. The work in the Junior high school not only covered personal hygiene, but also gave a preparation for the Regents' course in physiology, while the ad-

vqnced work of the upper classes of the high school was based upon this foundation -of scientific principles and attitude.

Any outline'or course of study is a vehicle of expression of the personality behind it', and may be varied a great deal by the teacher. . In general, however, our outline for the first year of the Junior high school, corresponding to the seventh grade, covers such topics as;- The living machine or human automobile; the skeleton as the framework of the body, and its hygiene; the skin, and hygiene of bathing and cleanliness; the teeth, their construction1 and care; our food tube, the alimentary canal; blood, the1 transporter; first aid to the injured; “safety first”; and habits of health. The program for the second year of the Junior high school is to a certain extent a review, but more an elaboration of the proceeding year's work. It approaches life from its cellular basis, showing how specialized cells can develop into such wonderful organisms as the ear, eye, nervous system, and then, with the elementary physiology of these organs, gives their hygiene. With this preparation, all ’ pupils approach the Regents’ course in physiology with a broad foundation.

The more advanced work in the high school includes community, group or social, as well' as personal hygiene. As most of the school athletes come from these upper classes, the first of the year is devoted to the question of diets, conditioning and training. . Under the topic of communicable diseases, the venereal diseases are discussed. In each case the method of transmittance of the disease is considered, which, in the case of venereal diseases, naturally leads to the physiology and hygiene of the male and female sex organs. Then with the seniors through the biological principles of reproduction and heredity in plants and animals, • the subjects of fertilization and embryology in the human organism are introduced. Thus there is an innocent and natural approach to sex instruction which helps create the desirable atmosphere.

Naturally it is taken for granted that the instructors have the training and personality to maintain a scientific poise, impart just enough information to satisfy but not to excite curiosity, and to promote an attitude of wholesomeness and idealism. In this way, hygiene comes to mean more to the pupils than a mere brush-your-teeth campaign and carries interest throughout the school course.1

The Problem of Fatigue. Fatigue is a phenomenon experienced so frequently among men that a definition of it scarcely seems necessary. Work is succeeded by weariness in the daily life of most of us; and the mere reminder of “that tired feeling” is often sufficient to promote an interest in short cuts to recuperation. The problem of fatigue is one that concerns the employer of labor who may fail to secure a satisfactory day’s output from his employee, if the activity of the latter is speeded up beyond a rate that is unduly fatiguing. The schoolmaster can make little satisfactory progress with fatigued school children; hence he must endeavor to avert conditions that demonstrably produce deterioration with respect to the ability to perform the tasks of learning. The physician rarely carries a patient through any considerable period of illness without receiving repeated reminders of what weariness as well as weakness means to the sick.

The textbooks glibly define fatigue as a more or less complete loss of muscular irritability and contractility, brought on by functional activity. Such a description could scarcely be expected to point the way to relief, for it fails to indicate the underlying causes that must be combated. The primary source of fatigue must lie in the performance involving the transformation of energy in the body, as there is no fatigue when all expenditure of effort is excluded. It is conceivable that the depletion of the stores of energy is responsible for fatigue; hence the recuperating power of rest that permits restitution of the loss. Or, it has been proposed that fatigue results when the pr ducts of muscle metabolism accumulate during work faster than they can be removed from the contractile organs. This is the “waste product” theory of fatigue. Half a century ago, the German physiologist Ranke expressed the belief that, as a result of the chemical changes occurring in the muscles during contraction, certain substances are formed which depress or inhibit the power of contraction. In this category of products, lactic acid or lactates, carbon dioxid and acid phosphates—all known to appear in muscles—have been included in the past. It is known, in fact, that the extent of the occurrence of some of these "fatigue substances” depends, in part at least, on the abundance of the oxygen supply to the muscles during their activity.

Far more startling was the announcement by Weichardt, twenty years ago, that there are formed in fatigue not simply the usually accepted fatigue substances, but a more specific substance, a true “fatigue toxin,” analogous to bacterial toxins, and that this is chiefly responsible for fatigue. Subsequently,

he asserted that a comparable toxic product, kenotoxin, can be obtained from proteins by a diversity of chemical manipulations outside the body. The climax of the widely discussed investigations was reached in the alleged production of an antitoxin, antikenotoxin, for which a patent was issued by the U. S. Patent Office. Although there are experiments on record in which the spraying of a school room atmosphere with a 1 per cent solution of the vague ‘‘antikenotoxin” was stated to have greatly increased the alertness and even the scholarship of the students, the reports lack confirmation, and Weichardt’s scheme has been almost entirely forgotten. Strangely enough, much of this structure of hypothesis was built on a foundation of utterly unconvincing evidence. Weichardt observed a variety of untoward symptoms when extracts of the muscles of highly fatigued animals were injected into test animals. They included reduction in temperature, slowing of respiration, sleep and untimely death. Lee and Aronovitch** of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, have demonstrated that juice from the muscles of nonfatigued animals exerts the same action as fatigue juice, both on animals and on excised muscles. The experiments thus fail to confirm Weichardt’s assumption of the existence of a specific toxin of fatigue. With this collapse of a fundamental claim, the entire superstructure of hypotheses is demolished. Por the present, we must continue to depend on rest as the best “antitoxin” to fatigue.

Music as a Medical Aid. We have heard a great deal lately about the therapeutic effects of music, but from the vantage point of a number of years’ experience as a teacher of both vocal and instrumental music, it seems to us that the benefits are largely imaginary. In some clinics, when local anesthesia is used, a Victrola is placed in the operating room to help divert the patient’s mind from the operative field, and in one operating room of which we know radio is installed for this purpose. Used in this way or as a vocational therapy, music doubtless has its uses along with any other absorbing and interesting occupation; but considered in any other light, we are convinced that at best its effects are not uniform or calculable while at worst it is useless and possibly dangerous.

No two individuals are affected in the same way by a given composition; nor is any individual always affected in the same way by the same composition or type of composition. Music is an expression alike of intellect and of mood or emotion, so that in prescribing it for a patient it is necessary to take into consideration not only his emotional condition and his transitory mood, but also the state of his intellectual development. “Yes, We Have No Bananas” might be exactly the right prescription for one patient, while another would be exceedingly

irritated by the banality, and soothed by the austerity of a Bach Fugye,which would leave the first patient bored or annoyed.

Music 'of an incompatible type will frequently aggravate a sane-person, especially when there is no escape from it. How much more, then, would it affect the hypersensitive insane or neurbtic? Unless administered as carefully as a drug it has possibilities of great harm. In certain instances it has doubtless had a beneficial effect, but to date no scientific study or observation has been reported that would place the subject on a basis definite enough to make it available for the average medical man. Unless the physician is also a musician—which is a-very rare combination—he is scarcely competent to undertake such a study. It is a promising field, but so large and so nebulous that it will likely be many years before it is reduced to a science.

Public Education in Health Matters. Sir George New-manr .chief medical officer of the ministry of health, has issued an iipportant memorandum on public education in health matters. He emphasizes the great importance of public opinion as a driving force behind sanitary and other hygienic measures. But it has; not kept pace with the recent great advances of medicine. Compulsory education has indeed contributed to progress in the understanding and interpretation of the laws of health. More reasonable dress, the disappearance of tight clothing and trailing	skirts,	a. far larger amount	of outdoor	exercise, more

active amusements and athletics, and the open-air life, have brought an immense improvement in the personal health of girls and women, an improvement that has abolished chlorosis, previously a common disease, and has materially affected the whole standard of their health. Another example of the effect of	public	opinion is the rapid	diminution	of spitting of

late, years, and there is a rise in the standard of cleanliness, personal and domestic. But public opinion is still in need of education on the whole subject of the applications of preventive medicine that may be made by the individual. In every direction the prevention of disease is becoming a personal concern rather than a matter dependent on the authorities. It is neglect of this personal aspect that is now	restricting the

operations and results of preventive medicine in many fields; and it is this personal aspect that accentuates the need for a greater	degree	of public education.	The need	for an educa-

tional campaign is shown by a heavy mortality and invalidity from causes largely preventable. Neglect of the common cold and behavior which insures its direct transmission to others, are widespread. Sufferers from colds breathe, sneeze and cough in other people’s faces, careless or ignorant of the fact that they are highly infectious. The habit of living, either at home or when at work, in overheated, ill ventilated rooms, and then

going out into cold winds and weather, predisposes to respiratory disease and infection.

The second great cause of sickness is declared to be digestive disturbance, which is frequently due to errors of diet. Knowledge of food values and the needs of the body is , lacking, with the result that much money is spent on unsuitable food, while many valuable and cheap foods are neglected Only by teaching what, when and how to cook and eat, and how to protect food from contamination, can we protect the function of the digestive system. Dental decay is the cause of much ill health, nearly all of it preventable. School medical and dental inspection has shown that more than half the school children at 8 years of age suffer from caries, and many of them from oral sepsis. In adolescents and adults this evil continues," producing • many terminal conditions, gastro-intestinal 'trouble, toxemia, joint affections and neurasthenia. The habitual and thorough cleansing of the teeth the last thing every nig'ht, the use of foods which, themselves, help to keep teeth cleain and periodic dental supervision are means of prevention. Every year the nation loses by death 3,000 mothers in childbirth; ana tens of thousands of young mothers are unnecessarily damaged or invalided thereby. Much of this maternal mortality and sickness could be prevented, yet only a small proportion of mothers submit to antenatal supervision. In 1923, there died in England and Wales 52,582 infants, more than 32,000 of them in the first three months from diesases in large measure preventable. Since the establishment of schools for mothers, of maternity and infant welfare centers, and of other educational agencies for helping mothers in their maternal duty, the infant mortality rate has fallen by 50 per cent.

Ideal Weather. Human comfort, so far as it is determined or modified by atmospheric or climatic environment, depends on a greater number of factors than is generally supposed. Our customs and activities are frequently altered to meet the respective conditions that arise. Muscular work, clothing, movement, artificial heating or cooling and ventilation may be concerned with the physiologic well being of man so far as this is modified by his atmospheric surroundings. Nearly a century has elapsed since Heberden pointed out that the ordinary mercury thermometer is a very inadequate instrument for measuring the physiologic effects of atmospheric conditions. It merely accounts for that part of the body heat lost by radiation and convection, whereas a great part of the body heat resulting from metabolic processes is eliminated by evaporation from the surface of the body. The ability to lose heat in the latter way depends in part on the relative humidity of the atmosphere. Although there are ways of measuring this and translating the results into terms of experience, the senses have

usually been the best guide. Movement of the air is a" further factor that favors removal of heat—perhaps the greatest factor of all, because the cooling, resulting from evaporation and convection largely depends on the velocity of the air Clothing may interfere with or modify the effects. As these different modifying features—temperature, relative humidity and air 'motion—may be independently variable, it is difficult to establish a single standard of comfort. Heat prostration may occur at quite unlike external temperatures in different places. The art of securing human comfort in the face of unfavorable environment is being studied more carefully than it has been in the past, particularly because of the demands of certain industries and the newer problem of the invasion of the tropics by persons from more temperate regions. Some indexes of the conditions to be established are therefore quite desirable. The latest investigations of the Bureau of Mines** show that while a temperature of 57.7 F. with no air motion is too cold for comfort, a temperature of 85.6 F. with an air motion of 500 feet a minute is too warm to be comfortable. Perhaps two intermediate conditions—say 70.8 F. at 50 feet a minute and 75.8 F. at 100 feet a minute— will appeal to the comfort of the average person, provided the humidity. is not outside the limits of the ordinary range. It is the problem of many arts to contribute toward securing these optimal environmental conditions for man. Here the stoker, the refrigeration expert, the clothier and furrier vie with one another in their attempts to thwart the machinations of the ubiquitous “weather man.”

The Physiologic Effect of Massage. Dr. Ralph Pemberton, F. A. Cajori, Ph. D. and C. Y. Crouter, M. S. of Philadelphia in a paper printed in The Journal of the Am. Med. Assoc. Nov. 29, 1924 discuss this subject and come to the following conclusions:

1.	Massage of voluntary muscles, even though vigorous, is not accompanied by the evidences of lactic acid production and acidosis, which accompany relatively mild active exercise of short duration, or by the evidences of loss of acid and alkalosis, which follow exposure of the body to external heat.

2.	Massage can be used as a partial substitute for active exercise in many conditions, but its benefit must be due chiefly to some mechanism other than that reflected in the chemical changes accompanying exercise. The available evidence suggests that these benefits are referable to changes in the circulation, especially capillary.

3.	The favorable influences on the rheumatic syndrome of exposure to external heat, massage and active exercise apparently find their chief explanation in their influence on tne

circulation, including the capillary beds. The corollary to this is that a disturbance of the circulation constituted part of the underlying pathologic change in. rheumatic and arthritic conditions.

The Basal Metabolism of Girls. Food has been defined to include “all the materials of which the body makes use in building up and repairing its tissues, in regulating its processes, in promoting its growth and health, and in obtaining energy for maintaining its warmth and doing work.”* It is to be ex-prected, therefore, that the needs for these materials—in other words, the dietary requirement— will vary in accord with certain conditions, among which the size of the individual, his activities and his age are foremost. It goes without saying that work requires energy and, other things being the same, a large person will have a greater need of energy than a smaller one. Many have regarded the requirement of age to be covered by the statement of size; for the young are, as a rule, far smaller than are adults. One of the significant contributions of human calorimetry has been the convincing demonstration that boys and girls in their teens need as much food as grown persons, and in some cases more. . Children from 2 to 12 years of age need surprisingly large amounts of food, as compared with grown persons. The child from 2 to 5 years of age needs about half as much food as is needed by a grown person of moderate activity, while children from 10 to 13 years of age may need fully as much food as they will need later in their teens. This, however, is not due merely to the augmented activities of youth, important though their seemingly ceaseless performances may be. The basal metabolism itself is augmented. In a recent study on girls representing more individual determinations for these ages than any before reported, MacLeod** of Columbia University had found the average basal heat output per kilogram of body weight in twenty-four hours to be: for age 11, 19.2 calories; for 12 years, 32.3.; for 13 years, 31.1 and for 14 years, 36.7. These figures are said to be even larger than has heretofore been indicated. And girls are not exceptions; for boys exemplify the same feature of augmented basal metabolism. Feed the children well!

Physical Fitness and 111 Health. The role of the physician in the community has come to be manifold; he is expected to right wrongs and relieve ills. Not only do immediate injuries and present maladies command his attention, but his duties are conceived in a far broader spirit. Modem medicine takes into account the possibilites of preventive as well as corrective measures. It aims to prolong life and to

Digitized by ^

L.oogie
656

conserve vitality; and human existence thereby should become more pleasant and efficient.

The broad-minded physician has been described as one who “conserves the money as well as the health of his patients; in a sense, he is a trustee both of their bodily welfare and of their finance^. In other words, a physician is not justified in prevailing on sick people to go to a great expanse for diagnostic tests or therapeutic procedures which are unnecessary or of theoretical interest; rather must he advise those measures which are as safe and certain as possible and which offer the prospect, through relieved symptoms, of a good return for the financial investment involved.”

The promotion of greater physical efficiency in those whose health has been impaired pot only is an economic necessity but also may become an unforeseen hygienic blessing. Joslin long ago wrote that any agency which promoted physical or mental hygiene is a step toward the prevention of diabetes in the predisposed and the abatement of its severity when it has appeared. Hence the dictum that diabetic patients should be kept mentally indolent and physically active. The day has now passed when every patient that is affected with a heart ailment is consigned to a life of enforced inactivity. Medical resourcefulness is expressed in part in the ability of the practitioner to select or devise tasks and exercise that will not injure those persons who labor under physical handicaps, and, to promote the possibilities of their continued usefulness in the world’s work.

From such standpoints, the use of insulin in the management of selected cases of diabetes has been hailed not only as a personal comfort but also as an excellent financial investment, in that it represents a purchasable gain in strength and efficiency. According to Miles and Root, the average diabetic patient is not physically fit, and furthermore is below normal mentally to various psychologic tests, approaching but not reaching a normal mentality with treatment. Fitz and Murphy of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital accordingly have emphasized that before the discovery of insulin treatment even the best treated diabetic patient in his struggle for existence usually carried a handicap of a measurably diminished physical and mental efficiency, and too often was compelled to face a slowly progressive course of physical and mental deterioration. The Boston clinicians have indicated specifically how the strength of many diabetic patients can be made to approach the normal by proper diet and physical therapy. The total calories of the diet rather than the fractions of carbohydrate, protein or fat seem of greatest importance in adding strength.

Contrary to the assumptions of some physicians, there is no evidence of any selective weakness of a particular group of muscles that characterizes diabetes. Consequently, massage, mechanotherapy or exercise directed to any single muscle or small group of muscles is not indicated; rather it is desirable

Digitized by
657

from the standpoint of physical therapy to introduce any general form of exercise that will bring all the muscles into play. One of the temptations offered by insulin is the possibility of fattening diabetic patients rapidly. This is demonstrably less advantageous than a scheme whereby patients gain weight and strength more slowly. In view of the current methods of underfeeding, it is timely to read Fitz and Murphy’s warning that undemutrition for any length of time is weakening and should not be recommended for more than a day or two, because the strength lost by such treatment is out of proportion to the tolerance gained. The best treatment for a diabetic patient, according to them, should combine diet and physical exercise, so that as the patient gains weight he gains a more than proportional amount of strength and an increasing strength-weight ratio. Diabetic patients should be not fattened rapidly with insulin and high calory diets. Such patients do not become as efficient physically as patients who gain weight more gradually on a lower diet and less insulin, and who remain thin but relatively strong with high strength-weight ratios. Finally, to encourage a spirit of cheerful optimism it should be recalled that not infrequently those who have diabetes and adjust their mode of living to it intelligently outlive their normal expectation of ife.

Dispensing with the Brain. One of the surprises that come early to almost every intelligent student of physiology is the extent to which seemingly good muscular performance can go on without the participation of the brain and its appendages. Decerebrate frogs would ordinarily pass for perfect animals if£they Jwere not inspected too rigorously. They are capable of well coordinated movements that often indicate a remarkable complexity of interdependent activities and sequences. Our appreciation of such reactions is, if anything, enhanced by the newer knowledge of what the normal movement of a limb really involves. There is not merely flexion due to the active contraction of a muscle attached to a bone. Skeletal muscles are generally organized into opposing groups. The contraction of one of these involves the relaxation or inhibition of its opponent; otherwise there might be much futile competition of antagonistic muscles, such as those that respectively open and close the hand or flex and extend an arm. This adjustment is the principle of “reciprocal innervation,”

Digitized by Google
658

whereby, when any muscles are thrown into contraction through the agency of the central nervous system, their opponent contractile structures are simultaneously inhibited.

The brain is not required for the rhythmic sequence of flexion and	extension that constitutes	the “reflex	step.”	Reflex

stepping	can be elicited in decerebrate aimals	when	suitable

stimuli are applied to the limbs and	feet; and it	is well	known

that the	nervous mechanism in the	lumbar and	sacral	regions

of the cord is in itself sufficient to produce the rhythm of stepping. Locomotion, the transition of the entire body from place to place in walking or running, involves a far more complex series of movements in which there is an ordered sequence of events—a coordinated movement of progression. According to elaborae investigations of Laughton* at the University of Western Toronto Medical School, at London, Ontario, these phenomena can no longer be obtained in the absence of the cerebral structures. The cerebellum is not an essential factor; but the nervous mechanism that functions in making possible the coordinated movements of progression is so arranged, in the cat and dog, that the caudal two thirds of the thalamus has to be intact for it to function normally. The corresponding mechanism in the rabbit is so arranged that the cephalic two. thirds of the pontile region must be intact for normal function.

However necessary some cerebral mechanism may be for the guidance and control of the movements of progression, the cerebral hemispheres are not of primary importance. Laughton pictures the act of progression as highly coordinated, the complex movements depending for their execution on the integrated action of the many nerve centers located at different levels in the cerebrospinal axis. Progression is the result of a sequence of events performed in part consciously and in part unconsciously. Any interruption of this normal march of events results in changes in the coordinated movements and, if the interruption is sufficiently great, the movements are eliminated. The harmonious action of the nervous system depends on the integrated action of all its parts. During its normal functioning, some impulses are inhibited while the passage of others is facilitated and they dominate the reflex pathways.

It may seem to some persons that, by the development of our knowledge of the function of the lower centers, little is being left for the higher brain structures to do. After all, the body is not merely a reflex mechanism wherein nervous stimulation and muscular response are the outstanding features. However admirable a brainless mechanism may be in the perfection of its remarkable reactions, it still lacks the power to profit by experience. The ability to learn and acquire new reactions is what makes the cerebrum dominant in the nervous system. Stiles has said that to remove the cerebrum is

to rob the individual of what it has acquired in living its own life. What remains is the common heritage of the race.

Speech Defects in School Children

By Viola Erickson

The matter of speech defects in the school child is one which has been strangely neglected, and about which there is much misconception and great ignorance among the majority of teachers and parents. Yet, when we realize the importance of speech, and how much depends on our ability to speak so that we are understood, it seems little short of a crime to neglect the children with speech defects. It has been estimated that in our country alone there are half a million children with speech defects, 200,000 of whom are stutterers.

There are two main classes of speech defects, (1) major— stuttering, (2) minor. defects of several types included under the term “lisping” Scripture gives four classes of lisping—(1) negligent lisping, (2) organic lisping, (3) neurotic lisping,—ana (4) cluttering.

Stuttering, as indicated, is the most serious. At the best, the stutterer’s social life is limited and abnormal. He often retires from social intercourse and becomes more or less eccentric. Few persons realize how terrible life becoms to a stutterer. It is usually so full of unpleasantness that it can hardly be said to be worth living.

The most frequent cause of stuttering is a nervous shock. Ghost stories and practical jokes, terrifying experiences, severe falls are often the causes of fright from which a child never recovers. Surgical operations are occasionally source of stuttering. The changing of a lefthanded person to using the right hand is sometimes a cause. Most of the stutterers from shock show a general condition of nervous excitability in which the predominant element is an abnormal state of expectancy toward persons and events.

A very frequent cause of stuttering is mental contagion by intentional or unintentional imitation. A boy thinks it fun to mock a stutterer, and ultimately finds that he himself can-

Digitized by Google
660

not stop stuttering. A stuttering parent nearly always has one or more stuttering children.

Stuttering frequently appears after whooping cough, also after scarlet fever, measles, influenza, etc. The cause seems to be in the condition of exhaustion.

The symptoms of a stutterer are several. The most striking symptoms are cramps or spasms of the muscles connected with speech. • Less frequent but more striking are the contractions of muscles not ordinarily used in speech. One will twist his head whenever he stutters badly; another will screw up one eye; another will contract his whole body, etc. Another kind of symptom, occurs in the “er”, “well”, etc, that the stutter uses to get started; sometimes this starter is an inarticulate but complicated grunt. An almost constant symptom is excessive rapidity of spech. In most cases it is the expression of nervous anxiety. A never failing symptom is the patient’s lack of confidence in his ability to speak correctly. The stutterer always lives with the fear that his speech may “go back on him.” The fear of being ridiculous is nearly always present, also a condition of mental flurry. With very rare exceptions the stutterer does not stutter when he knows no one can hear what he says.

Three forms or stages of stuttering may be distinquished. The simplest form is that of “pure habit.” Such a case occurs where a younger child unintentionally copies the stuttering of an older one. The stutterer nearly always goes beyond the habit stage. People laugh at him, mock him, scold him, threaten him with punishment, or whip him. A new element, the “fear of displeasing and appearing' ridiculous,” produces the “fright stage.” The stuttering is now a distinct psychoneurosis that may have the most far reaching consequences. A third stage is where the stutterer is no longer embarrassed by his defect. It is obnoxious to him, but the fright has disappeared. This may be termed the “stage of indifference”. It is usually found in old patients.

The first step in the cure of stuttering is to look after the patient’s bodily and mental health. This is very essential. The treatment of stuttering itself is based on the following principles which Scripture explains, but for which there is no space here: principles of a new method of speaking, of relaxation, of habit formation, of spontaneity, of decreasing embarrassment, of equilibration, of correct thinking, of correct enun-ication, of belief in the success of the treatment, of correction of character, of subconscious readjustment.

Thus it will be seen that the treatment of stuttering is a complicated thing, and requires expert knowledge of the disease and of the patient.

Lisping, the second class of defects, is the most common speech defect, especially in the lower grades and the preschool period.

661

Negligent lisping includes “baby talk” and careless enunciation. A great many children show this defect, but usually overcome it as they learn to talk correctly. If it continues, however, a mental examintion will usually reveal mental retardation. Careless enunciation may be due to poor models in speaking or to lack of care in producing the correct sounds, which if continued, become a habit. The cure consists in carefully teaching the patient to correct his faults through twining in phonics.

“Organic lisping” is the term that may be applied to such speech defects as arise from anatomical defects of the vocal organs. These include hare lip, feeble lips, tongue defects, tongue tie, jaw and tooth defects, high palatal arch, cleft palate. obstructed nasal passages, defective hearing. Slight defects may be overcome by persistence on the part of the teacher and child. Higher degrees of defect require first, surgical treatment, and later, training to talk.

“Neurotic lisping” is allied to stuttering in its cause (i.e. fright, nervous strain) and in the presence of an emotional disturbance. It differs in having excessive muscular tension of a constant rather than a spasmodic kind. It occurs in highly nervous children and results from over-anxiety as to form of speech. The cure lies in a general treatment for nervousness, and in teaching the patient to relax while talking.

The last type “cluttering” is characterized by great nervousness that shows itself in excessive rapidity of speech with indistinct enunciation. Cluttering^is usually combined with stuttering, but it can be distinguished from it. In the one there is nervous haste in the other nervous fear. The clut-terer speaks better the more he thinks about his speech; the stutterer vice versa. The clutterer shows negligence and lack of	self-control.	The	treatment consists of	tongue gymnastics,

of exercises in enunciating words singly, and in spealang slowly and distinctly. The nervous condition should also be treated.

Mention should,	perhaps, be made of	the	foreign accent,

which is met in many children of foreign parentage, and may be considered as a speech defect. It consists mainly of three things (1) Giving of improper or false accents to our vowels, (2) Placing stress on wrong syllable; and (3) The rising inflection at	the end of	every	phrase and sentence.	The	treatment consists in phonic	drills,	training in voice inflection,	etc.

In the last forty years extensive strides have been made in the correction of disordered speech throughout Germany, Austria, France, England, and Japan. Zurich in 1899 started a school vacation colony which has been very valuable and successful in curing stuttering of children. A great many countries have after school lessons by an especially trained teacher. This method has some disadvantages as it comes at a most fatiguing part of the day. In Berlin and throughout Hungary

there are special classes which meet daily during school hours A few European cities have established all day special schools for stutterers. These are the ideal kind.

Europe has been very successful in this work and is somewhat in advance of the United States. But even here more attention is being paid to the matter. More than forty cities have Speech Improvement classes and Speech clinics in con-juction with their school system. Some of the foremost in this work are Chicago, Detroit, and New York. The speech clinic consists, or should consist, of three individuals with three functions—superintendent, doctor and teacher; supervisor, diagnosis, and treatment.

An important factor in the success of this work is this: Modem medicine and psychology have put to their credit a notable achievement by tne demonstration that defective speech is at bottom a mental rather than a physical disease, where a definite defect of speech organs does not exist.”

Unconsciousness or Insensibility

These terms are simply two different names for the same thing, and possibly there is no other condition which is so apt to puzzle one, as just this state in which one may be found lying because there are so many causes for it. As for instance, severe injuries to the skull causing concussion and compression of the brain. Also certain diseases of the brain as apoplexy, epilepsy, hysteria; and among the more common causes—fainting, shock, poisoning, sunstroke, heat exhaustion, bleeding, electric shock, freezing or suffocation. Be careful to ascertain from by-standers what the cause was. If no one is able to explain, or none but yourself and the patient is there, then quickly study person and surroundings and examine for any of the causes as mentioned above. If there is evidence that the case is serious, send for medical help, and in the meantime see that the patient is placed in a position where breathing is most easy. If the face is pale, keep the head low, but if flushed, raise the head slightly, lossen tight clothing at neck, chest, waist. If patient is cold cover with blanket or other wraps, and provide fresh air.

But be careful to note the following symptoms: If the breathing is rapid, or comes as in sighs, if beads of sweat stand out on face; if skin is cold abd clammy; if the pulse rapid or imperceptible, then they are in a state of shock or collapse, and no time must be lost in an endeavor to revive. Sponge face with weak vinegar or aromatic spirits of ammonia, or sprinkle

with cold water; hold smelling salts to nostrils momentarily, gently shake and speak to arouse, and when consciousness returns give stimulant, preferably aromatic spirits of ammonia (1-2 teaspoonsful in 1-2 glass water). If there is profuse bleeding, flex limb or apply tourniquet. But if evidence of internal bleeding, keep patient on side in recumbent position so that in event of blood oozing from mouth or in case of vomiting, they will not choke. Blood which is coughed up frothy and bright red, is from the lungs; blood vomited and dark red is from stomach. When they revive give chopped ice to suck and apply cold cloths to lungs and stomach, as case may be.

Injuries to head with continued insensibility, simply call for general care of condition and patient attention till medical help arrives.

If the condition is due to sunstroke, remove quickly to shady place; remove clothing to waist line; place in semi-sitting position; dash cold water on face and chest, and keept ice bag to head. When revived give cold water freely to drink.

If electric shock, remove cause, if still near cause, and if lung action has ceased, perform artificial respiration. When breathing is restored and consciousness returns, treat burns, if any, and give stimulant as in shock.

If heat exhaustion, body will be cold and clammy as in shock, with similar conditions as to breathing and pulse. Remove to quiet place, loosen clothing; if the temperature is below normal, keep body warm with covers, and when conscious administer stimulant as above, or hot tea or coffee.

But if cause of condition was suffocation, following smoke, gas or water, artificial respiration will be the first duty to perform, which will occupy a separate article to follow.

Fainting is really an emotional affection, something causing the blood to leave the head to succor the heart, and the consequent pale face and collapse causing one to fall. Fainting may be easily avoided if one will bend over, if sitting, or if standing, stoop over, as if one were going to pick up something. In the case of another, if they seem to be on the verge of faint-ting, place a hand on belt in front and with other hand force the head over, and the swoon is prevented.

If one is in a faint, don’t pick them up. Loosen tight clothing, fan, sprinkle water on face and hold smelling salts to nostrils momentarily. When conscious give cold water to drink.

BOXING IN SCHOOLS

Translated From Dr. H. Sippel by D. V. Besser At a recent gathering of schoolmen and sports at Berlin, Germany, the question was discussed, should boxing be taught in schools. The opinion prevailed that if boxing could be introduced it should first be made optional and later obligatory. The advocates of self-defence declared that its hygienic value affects the entire body, because during training and contests the upper and lower extremities are extensively exercised and the heart and lungs are strengthened. From the psychological point they claimed it promotes courage, selfreliance and determination........... The	opponents admitted that boxing is

a healthful exercise, but opposed it on general principles. They declared that apparatus work, track and field events, calisthenics, ball, games and swimming will accomplish all that which is claimed for boxing. Some held the view that the introduction of this sport in our elementary schools would be unwise and the gain negligible. Others opined that its educational value is overrated and would result in arousing brutality. The array of opponents caused this measure to be tabled.

Some thought the most appropriate time to instruct the pupils in the art of self-defence was during their secondary school life. The opinion prevailed that boxing at this age is of high educational value. Some declared its activities promote prowess, manliness and resoluteness. A number of dissenting voices called the sport brutal and remarked its introduction would have the tendency to do more harm than good. They claimed the school is not its proper place..............

..........The consensus of opinion as to the wisdom of

recommending boxing in the schools was so divergent, that no official vote was recorded. The interested parties will soon gather again for the purpose of arriving at a possible understanding.

In the editorial column of the Boston Traveler we find the following stimulating comments by Mr. Frank W. Wright of the Massachusetts State Commission of Education.

It is much easier to be critical than accurate in dealing with topics under discussion. It has ever been the charge that each generation suffers in comparison with its predecessors. The world has, notwithstanding such criticism, seen tremendous social progress through the efforts of each succeeding generation to add to its social heritage. It will be admitted, however, that there is some basis for inquiry as to the influence of modem

life upon youth. In its search for new freedom, youth shows some of the effects of an age all too much inclined to pleasure and excitement.

The widespread use of the automobile in quest of pleasure the lack of discrimination in the choice of entertainment as provided by the omnipresent movie, and theatre; premature social ambitions of parents for their children; too much spending money with too little instruction in how to spend it: and unprofitable leisure as the result of cheap amusement and unplanned recreation, all in the end, will lead to a lowering of standards of conduct on the part of youth. It is not surprising that some of these influence the outlook of young folks of today upon life. It is not surprising that* some of the conventions seem irksome to them, when their elders, in so many instances, show a lack of appreciation of the finer things in life, and of respect for constituted authority. A little more old-fashioned parenthood would be of assistance to modem youth.

News, notes and comments

A New Kind of State Superintendent. Francis B. Haas, Pennsylvania’s new Superintendent of Public Instruction, was bora in Philadelphia June 6, 1884. His elementary and secondary work was done in the Philadelphia public schools. Following his graduation from Central High School in 1904, he decided on teaching as his life’s work and entered the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy. In 1906 he took his first teaching position in the Kenderton Elementary School.

The various phases of Mr. Haas’ classroon ability found expression in the organization of extra-curricular activities. He was among the first in Philadelphia to develop on a systematic basis inter-school athletics and school play-days. Both of these lines of activity have, in the years between, grown to large pro-

S>rtions and have been organized under the direction of the epartment of Physical Education for the public schools of Philadelphia on a city-wide and comprehensive basis. Mr. Haas was associated with the Playgrounds Association and was one of the moving spirits in the Philadelphia Grammar School Athletic League, the outdoor and the boys’ camp movements.

The Sportsmanship Brotherhood, is the name of a new organization in the state of Massachusetts. Its object is “to foster and spread the spirit of sportsmanship throughout the world”. The organization has just sent the following letter to all high schools in the state:

In order to avoid misconception, it must be stated that the Sportsmanship Brotherhood has no intention of attempting

Digitized by VjOO^I.0
666

to interfere in any way whatsoever with the Governing Bodies of Sports and Games. Its work is purely educational.

The Spirit of Sportsmanship is not new. In the last analysis it is in essence the Golden Rule. “Whatsoever things therefore ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.’* It is obvious that the medium through which this spirit can best be inculcated in children is that of sports and games. The immediate objective of the Sportsmanship Brotherhood is to organize the presentation of awards in every school in Massachusetts for the pupils who throughout the year show the best spirit of sportsmanship, not only on the athletic field but in their whole conduct and attitude to teachers, school-fellows and neighbors.

The recognition of the moral and educational value of athletics, apart from physical benefits, is now widespread and has a strong public opinion behind it especially amongst the parents of school children.

To stress and publicly reward good sportsmanship is the endeavor of those who organized the brotherhood. Not that they think that by doing so they are introducing new thoughts but rather that definite emphasis may be placed on and specific recognition given to the spirit of sportsmanship in the widest sense of the term.

Your school will in due course be invited to become a chapter of the Sportsmanship Brotherhood and a charter of membership which includes the Constitution and Rules of the Brotherhood will be sent to you.

Many influential people outside Massachusetts are waiting to see the scheme worked out in the schools of our State and it is confidently anticipated that the movement will develop on national lines. It has been born in Massachusetts and it is up to Massachusetts to lead the way.

We trust that our object may have your approval. And you are cordially invited to offer suggestions and to ask any questions which may arise in your mind.

May we take it that if you do not think it necessary to answer this communication you are in favor of the proposed scheme?

Respectfully yours,

Percy R. Creed, Secretary.

In the “Campus”, Northwestern University, the following outburst appeared in the recent issue.

“We are tired of this everlasting blah blah about a winning football team. We are tired of having a football coach who trains forty men, and receives as large a salary as four instructors who teach one particular subject to six hundred students. We are tired of having alumni come back and say what a fine half back there is in Podunk High School, and can’t we get a job for him. We are tired of this stadium

bunk whereby fifty thousand spectators watch twenty-two men or rather employees, battle for supremacy. We are tired of being told that Northwestern needs more men.”

“The Nation”, in commenting upon the above says: “We are inspired, not tired, of these outbreaking students.”

Editor. It is a hopeful sign when the editors of a college paper begin to question the wisdom of some of the college proceedings undertaken in the name of athletics for all. “Athletics for revenue” appears to be the driving force at the back of most of the competition that daily fills our newspapers. If, accompanying this revenue-proceeding type of organization, there were any apparent effort to give to all the students of a college a fair share of athletic competition, the results might not be so bad as they now are. This, however, will never come about until athletics are taken and administered by colleges instead of by an uncontrollable board of alumni; and this will mean the expenditure of much money by the college. Only in a few of the smaller colleges is there any evidence that faculty control is even thought of.

The annual banquet of the Henry Suder Club was held in the East room of the LaSalle Hotel, March 14th. The occasion marks an epoch in the history of Physical Education in Chicago public schools inasmuch as it represents the accomplishment of an aim long cherished by the club, namely the appointment of a woman to the position of supervisor of girls’ athletics, Miss Vera Gardner of Hyde Park High School is the newly appointed supervisor, and it was in her honor that the banquet was given.

Other guests of the club were the superintendent of schools, Mr. William McAndrew and Mrs. McAndrew; a member of the Board of Education, Mrs. Hefferan, who has proven herself interested in the physical well-being of the school children; the newly appointed Director of Physical Education in Chicago schools, Mr. E. C. Delaporte and Mrs. Delaporte; Major F. L. Beals, Director of Military Training, who has always been a valued friend of the club.

The Henry Suder Club was organized about four years ago by the women teachers of physical education in the Chicago High Schools for the purpose of promoting the cause of physical education and rational athletics. It was named for Mr. Henry Suder, the man who might be called “The Father of Physical Education in the Chicago Schools,” for it was through his untiring efforts and kindly leadership that the work was established.

The club has five regular evening meetings a year, one of which is social, usually a banquet. Lecturers this year have been Dr. H. W. Gentles, First Aid Division of the Red Cross; Dr. D. P. MacMillan, Head of Child Study Department of the Chicago Board of Education; Mr. Wm. J. Bogan, Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Chicago. Alternate months the

club publishes a bulletin which contains reports of activities in athletics, physiotherapy, business pertinent to the work, news, personals, in fact anything which the editor considers of interest. There is a different editor for each bulletin.

The club is a progressive, happy organization indebted to each individual member for its present well being.

VIEWPOINTS REGARDING PROGRAMS

Whenever the editor sees a program that appears to be of more than ordinary interest, he tries to secure some of the compositions for publication in “Mind and Body”. A quest for such material led to the writing of a letter to Mr. William K. Streit of Newport, Ky. His answer is so valuable that we take the liberty of printing it for the benefit of many of our readers who often write to us for advice or for material.

“In the four Anniversary exhibitions that I have given at Newport, it has been my aim to show to the public the many possibilities of physical education; to give a well balanced program of activities and at the same time make it pleasing to the eye, and effective. There has always been some singing both at the beginning and at the end—with the audience joining in. There has always been a good speaker to talk on physical education at the conclusion of tne demonstration.

In addition, the last part of the show always takes the form of a pageant or festival. This year it was Chinese. It is also necessary to consider the type of people who constitute the spectators, and use some pychology on them. The little tots are always good and get tne sympathy of the spectators in the beginning. Then I give them a good “laughing number,” and anything that comes after that will be approved—providing it isn’t too long.

Costuming and lighting effects add about 60 per cent to the effectiveness of any snow. I also save the feature number, the most spectacular number, until last—thus leaving a good “taste” in the mind of the spectators, since recency is an important factor in memory.

I don’t believe that many of the numbers that I used in my last exhibition are worthy of being published. Some of them are merely a combination of things that I have picked up from many sources and have thrown together to make this particular exhibition, few of the numbers—as such—are original. I haven’t time

jvelop the new things, but merely take the good things that I run across in my experience and use than.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON ATHLETICS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOL PRINCIPALS

Your Committee begs leave to submit the following report: The first matter to engage the attention of your committee is the problem of interstate athletics. The phenomenal growth of inter-scholastic athletics in the secondary schools in the last few years has created a national problem in their administration. This growth is a continuation of a situation which has arisen in the various states and which has been met by the states by the organization of strong state athletic associations. Following the analogy of the development of the state associations, this nation-wide problem can only be met by the development of a strong national organization to cope with it. The rise and rapid evolution of the National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations seems to indicate that it is the appropriate organization for this purpose, since it already has sixteen states incorporated into it and other states planning to enter it.

It has already formulated a far-reaching program and has achieved significant results. Some specific instances may be given as illustrations of the type of work about to be undertaken by it:

1.	Representation of the high schools of the country in giving voice to the point of view of the high schools in making the rules for the various inter-scholastic sports.

2.	The 'standardization of eligibility rules, in interstate, inter-scholastic contests.

3.	The National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations provides a medium of articulation with other amateur athletic organizations which have national scope.

It is therefore the recommendation of your committee that the National Association of Secondary School Principals endorse the National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations as the recognized and proper agency for the administration of inter-scholastic athletics in their interstate and national phases.

The second subject which the committee believes worthy of your attention is the growing tendency to organize interscholastic athletic teams among girls. Inherent evils in interscholastic competition among girls demand its suppression. These evils are so patent that they do not require much discussion. The extremely strenuous physical and mental exertion and strain are a menace to girls in the high school period. Furthermore, sooner or later, the spectacle of inter-scholastic contests among girls gives rise to undesirable and even morbid social influences among both boys and girls, and in the community life as well.

The committee, therefore, recommends that the National Association of Secondary School Principals throw the weight of its influence against inter-scholastic athletics amQng girls and that wherever possible state athletic associations be induced to legislate against them.

The third matter which the committee wishes to bring to your attention is the growing evil of inter-sectional athletic contests and post-season games. They are both the outgrowth of an excessive desire to win championships. Inter-sectional contests are detrimental to the educational interests of boys in that they detract their attention from the real goals of school work and take them away from that work for extended periods of time. Post-season games distort the real aims of inter-scholastic athletics, over-emphasize championships and prolong unduly the stress of the athletic season concerned.

The Committee therefore recommends that the National Association of Secondary School Principals throw the weight of its influence against inter-sectional athletic contests and post-season games and that its members do all they can to eliminate these evils in their respective states.

This report at the Chicago meeting of the association was adopted recommendation by recommendation, and as a whole, and the committee was discharged.

Light and Growth. The treatment of tuberculous patients by exposure to the direct rays of the sun received an impetus from the work of Bernhard and Rollier twenty years ago. Their attempts mark the beginnings of various aspects of modern heliotherapy. Finsen employed radiant energy in the form of a special arc light in his attack on lupus. The curative action of ultraviolet rays on rickets dates back only to 1919, when Huldschinsky reported the favorable results that he secured in the treatment of rachitic children with irradiation by the mercury vapor quartz lamp; while Hess and Unger first demonstrated that successful treatment could also be secured with sunlight alone.

Thus, therapy with various types of radiant energy has come rapidly into prominence and has tended to give unanticipated emphasis to the presumable importance of light in relation to human and animal welfare. There are indications that light can act in more than one way; it may inhibit pathologic processes or destroy pathogenic organisms, or it may conceivably promote some of the bodily functions that are perhaps dependent on a stimulus from without. In the case of nckets, in which the experience with human beings has been checked by comparable observations on experimental animals, light rays seem to supply something analogous to certain food factors. The consensus at present is that, if the diet is adequate in respect to all the known essentials, no other protection against rickets will be required. However, even an expert student of the subject had recently remarked in this connection that it is necessary to emphasize the extreme limitations of our knowledge concerning the specific effects of the organic components of the diet.

In pediatrics, the problem of rickets is closely associated with that of growth, and consequently the query as to the possible influence of light on growth is likely to be raised. The human clinic is not well adapted to afford a conclusive answer. Among those who have had recourse to observation on animals, Eckstein of the Children's Clinic at Freiburg in Baden has secured decisive results. Like others, he has found that, when the diet is entirely adequate, confinement in darkness over long periods does not necessarily lead to rickets. Furthermore, the development of adolescent animals in respect to size and weight under comparable dietary conditions and hereditary impulses is the same regardless of the sort of natural light, whether red or blue, for example, to which they are continuously exposed. There is no reason to suppose that the growth of the higher animals is dependent on light. This dogmatic statement ought, however, to be accompanied with an equally forceful reminder that light may nevertheless exert potent physiologic effects, when appropriate conditions for its influence present themselves.

BOOK REVIEWS

"Personal Hygiene Applied” by Jesse Feiring Williams, A. B., M. D. Second Edition, Revised. W. B. Saunders Company 1925. Price $2.00.

"Williams’ Personal Hygiene Applied” is not merely a hygiene book. It is not even primarily a hygiene book. It is more of a sociological treatise whose keynote is "to live most and serve best.”

Personal health is not to be attained solely for its concomitant joy and happiness, for true joy and happiness are achieved only through service to others. "The physical aspects of health must be interpreted along with the mental and social.” "The causes of ill health and disease are social and mental as definitely, though not so frequently, as physical causes.” The body must be a perfect “temple of the soul”—a capable servant, "ready and trained to serve high causes and noble ends.”

Especially interesting in his treatment of personal hygiene are Dr. Williams’ rapid historical background sketches. It informs the reader ofithe^great progress in the science and art of healing, as well£as hints at what we might well expect of medicine and its?applied sciences in the future.

As to the subject matter dealing with personal hygiene, the book is£up to date, authoritative and well arranged to serve the purposes of a college text book, as well as a convenient and reliable reference book for the teacher's desk.—R.M GoU.

"The Foundation of Health” by William Barnard Sharp,

S.	M., M. D., Ph. D. Lea and Febiger 1924. Price $2.50.

Somewhat in contrast to Williams’ treatment of hygiene is Dr. Sharp’s rather direct, matter of fact presentation of hygienic information. This is a book of facts—a book that answers oft asked questions. If one wants information on the care of the hair, or on the complexion, or on specific antiseptics, it is there. Further, the comprehensive index directs one to the proper page without any “hunting.”

There is a paragraph of ridiculous piffle on the “Prevention of Conception” which the reviewer must take a sentence to characterize as such.

This is a valuable book, intended as a text for use in the early college years and admirably adapted for that purpose.

n, W,

"Recreative Athletics” 128 pages, 4 by 9 inches, heavy paper cover. Price 60 cents. Published by A. S. Barnes & Co., New York.

This is a revised and enlarged edition of the booklet prepared by the Playground and Recreation Association of America. It is a handy and very serviceable compilation of such materials that playground and recreation leaders need. Most school teachers also will find the booklet valuable when planning and conducting school field days. A limited bibliography should help those that are looking for more material than that found in the booklet.	W.	A.	S.
