RHYTHMIC MOTION AND MUSIC AS FACTORS IN EDUCATION.

By ANNE ELIZABETH ALLEN, Head Kindergarten Dept. Chicago Normal.

IF I were asked what class of people are the busiest in the world and who most skilled in keeping every one around them occupied every moment, it would not take me long to decide upon the smallest members of the human society commonly called “Babies.”

How many of you would agree with me I should be willing to wager ; especially would mothers and kindergarteners applaud I know.

What does all of this activity and energy mean and what shall be done with it ? It evidently has a purpose, for every healthy normal infant has a superabundance of it often to the destruction of all comfort and happiness for the grown folks in a home. We believe that it is a god-given instinct of the baby’s to-day and are beginning to appreciate and try to direct it instead of deprecating it and bemoaning the fate of those who have to deal with it.

The, how to direct it, is still puzzling us all and what is more will continue to be a problem so long as there are a race of little folks to be dealt with.

So long as the infants of some savage races are small enough to be perfectly irresponsible, their parents have seen fit to strap them up in basket or bundle with k convenient handle whereby the neatly bound package might be swung to'a tree or its mother’s back, high and dry for safe keeping. Even in our day and generation, with the civilization of century upon century behind us, we have swaddled our new born infants, first with an atrocius tight, unyielding band around the tiny*

• -In -Ihesey SviaddJing clothes a child stays until he is ready to use his feet and legs in walking which certainly is not so easy a thing as it would be with the strength he might have been gaining all these months from free exercise and constant use. We are becomming more enlightened and our fin de siecle baby is enjoying the physical freedom that short, loose clothing will give him, and his activity is not only borne with patience but encouraged and guided into wholesome channels.

All of those who have not read and studied Froebel’s “Mother Play” would, I know, be surprised to find how much help he has left as a legacy to mothers, along the line of directing the activity of little children. Have you ever watched a baby at his play ? For weeks and months his movements are unrhythmical, indefinite and irregular in every way. Gradually we see this uncertain, undirected, uncontrolled motion begin to smooth out. His hand no longer shakes and moves with jerks, for his eye is learning and his hand steadies under its guidance and the control it has learned from its many experiences. His body begins to respond in movement to the sounds he hears. A jingly, choppy rhyme he cleverly learns to follow in the pounding of his little fists, or the kicking of his heels against the chair or floor.

Watch these movements repeat themselves, at first at long intervals, then at shorter ones, increasing in frequency until whenever certain regular, time-marked beats of piano, voice, or a one toned sound is heard, the response naturally follows and behold ! the first rhythmic movement has blossomed in the child, and he has started on the direct road to music and its appreciation.

Mr. Wm. Tomlins, who has done such wonderful work in singing with the little children of this city, says that the time-measured kick of the small boy’s heel against the fence (and I presume the same holds good for the small girls who climb fences and kick,) is the music in his soul, striving for freedom in expression, and I believe that in many instances this shows itself much earlier than the fence climbing period. I have in mind a tiny girl, too young to walk but able to pull herself up to a chair, who used to stand in a room over the parlor when her aunt practiced each day, keeping time with her little feet, to the good, sometimes classical music she heard and many times when a difficult passage was reached and the performer hesitated and played more slowly, up the little feet stayed until the time became even enough for her to follow and her face showed marked signs of irritation until the time measured evenly again. In order to be free, one must have a flexible, graceful body. How many would be sorry to part with the awkward body that refuses to lend itself to the grace of heart and mind imprisoned in it, unable to reveal itself except to the chosen few who may enter into her life with her ?

How enviable is the person who has a well-trained, graceful, well-controlled body, who makes an easy entre into a room of strangers,

Digitized by LjOOQle
passing by foot-stools, over the rolled edges of rugs, through small spaces, all obtrusively conspicuous objects and places to the awkward, finally seating herself with dignity and grace on perhaps the most uncomfortable spot the room affords.

Enviable, indeed, not for the grace alone, but for the freedom which her pliant body gives her mind and her total unconsciousness of this avenue of expression, the most perfect of God’s gifts.

If the cultivation of grace, and grace alone, were the reason for inculcating early into the life of a child, this ease of motion should ask if the end does not justify the means ; but I believe there is a deeper meaning in his early manifestations along this as well as all other lines than we are yet wise enough to read, and in this direction more than we are at first perhaps willing to grant.

While we may have the semblance of gracefulness and unconsciousness of self without the true inward harmony with external surroundings, the real thing is only developed through the unifying of thought and action.

To begin with, then, a child’s whole being is essentially active, and this activity, whatever its manifestation, must be our guide in training him. Just the one note of a clear, resonant toned triangle catches a baby’s ear and he moves in response to it. A Mother Goose rhyme belongs to him as truly as it fills his need. A simple little strain of a song without words he learns to love and react towards. Why shouldn’t we train his physical activity now, while his whole body is crying out for direction and help, as well as his mental activity, when it begins to demand nourishment which all hasten to furnish? Why shouldn’t we help him to keep time to rhyme or music with his hand, feet, and finally his whole body when it will help to develop him in a rounded way as nothing else can do in his earliest life ?

Many a pain would be soothed, many a heartache comforted, while thus learning in the way he so loves to learn, through play with his mother, the road to freedom along the path that now so widely opens to him.

Day in and day out, over and over, is the motto for her who would train a little child, following his own direction while leading and guiding him into better ways. From these first little movements, when the mother takes in her own the hands of the baby and swings them in time, or the little feet and helps him to stretch out his legs and draw them back as she sings to him, the child grows strong, his flesh becomes firm, and when he finally walks it is not so difficult an accomplishment as it otherwise would have been. When he learns to walk, then to march in time to music, then to run, keeping time to a galop, rapidly played or sung, then he is finally ready for a skip, the most difficult of all, requiring more balance of the body and consequent added strength.

Had every child this home training for his first three years, what wonders in the way of rhythmic movement might be accomplished in the Kindergarten, which might then fix for life the habit of easy movement. I have found, after many years of experience, that the skipping, running, sliding, etc., does more in our little community to bring the children into harmonious relations with each other and surroundings

than does any other part of the kindergarten work. Through these exercises alone the ethics of social life may enter into their consciousness truly and really. The harmony and correct poise of the body reacts upon them spiritually and mentally and tends to balance and adjust them as nothing else I have ever found will do. I cannot give too much credit along these lines to this side of our work, as I have often and often seen the little awkward, diffident, self-conscious, unexpressive child gradually blossom out and grow free as her body learned to express itself in response to rhythmic music. I have in mind now one of our little girls who came to us in September, who was leading a life entirely apart from other children, who would have nothing to do with others in the kindergarten for weeks, sitting in her chair, absorbed in her own thoughts, totally unmindful of her relations to humanity, and selfishly hugging her seclusion under the mask of indifference. Music was the first thing that reached her in her lonesomeness, and great was the rejoicing when her little soul one morning struggled for expression through her lips as she joined us in a song. Gradually she was led to join in the physical exercises, joined one day in a game, was constantly invited to skip, and now she is one of us.	(To	be	concluded.)

On the Value of Athletic Exercise as a Counter Agent to the Sedentary Pursuits of Urban Population.

By SIR DYCE DUCKWORTH, M. D., LL. D., Physician and Lecturer on Medicine, St, Bartholomew’s Hospital, London; Hon. Physician to H. R. H., the Prince of Wales.

(Continued.)

[KNOW well that authorities in this town are well in the van of those1 who have been active in demolishing “rookeries” and securing airspaces for the people, and they are now reaping the benefits of this wise procedure on the part of one of the most enlightened municipalities in the kingdom. If I am not mistaken, there is still a good deal more to do and to accomplish before the atmosphere rivals that of Pittsburg, now so improved, the Birmingham of the United States, which, when I knew it, twenty years ago, was something never to be forgotten. A few more coal-strikes, and we shall learn to be much less dependent on crude fuel of that description, “stinking coals,” as Ruskin calls them, and have to turn our colliers out of the bowels of the earth to plow its surface in the face of heaven.

To return, however, to consider other malign influences of town-life. One very difficult matter for citizens is to secure sufficient bodily exercise. If we are engaged in business, we must needs dwell near our work. In early life there is a natural craving in healthy persons for exercise in the open air, and when business pursuits are followed with the freedom from worry and anxiety which seldem attaches to ’prentice hands, the m ornings and evenings of summer and the modern half-holiday are fully availed of. Hence, the cricket and football fields are in request by all wholesome young Britons.

The cyclists, too, so improperly called by Mr. Edmund Yates “cads

Digitized by U.ooQle
on casters,” nowadays are not disposed to lose their opportunities for trundling along our roads in all directions. All this is excellent.

One great advantage of active exercise and of athletics in general is that no one can be excellent or proficient in them who is not always perfectly temperate in the use of strong drinks. You cannot imagine a cyclist given over to drink, or a vigorous football player or a marksman amongst volunteers who did not know how to control himself in the presence of the tankard or the bottle. Hence we hail all athletic pursuits as correctives of our terrible national proclivity to take too much strong liquor.

As middle-life is approached and business becomes more serious, marriage being accomplished and olive branches having shot out, men tend to sit closer to their work, and gradually give up their exercise. They say they have no time for it, and they gradually lose zest for what is so needful, so imperatively needful, if they are to maintain vigorous minds in vigorous bodies.

I allow that there is instinctively a growing disinclination for the activities that were formerly attractive and pleasant in earlier life, and a tendency to grow stout, perhaps corpulent, especially below the belt, at the time of life I allude to. But it is not to be accepted or encouraged. I appeal now to the wives and sisters of such men as I describe, and must ask them to urge their better halves or their brothers to take sufficient active exercise, and to have a pride in their figures, and I must ask these men to feel humiliated and sorry when their tailors offer them congratulations on their increasing dimensions and the necessary draft on broadcloth. For this is regrettable, truly a sign of degeneration, and not, in most instances, indicative of vigor of body. Never lose your “frock-coat figure,“ once said a witty Irishman.

Those of you interested in athletics may very readily recognize a townsman by grasping the upper part of his arm. You will find it commonly thin and soft as compared with his forearm or with the muscles of his thighs and his calves. This shows that the legs of a townsman are in better condition than his arms, also, that the use of his hands entails a better state of the muscles of his forearms, while his flabby upper arms indicate that he has little occasion to exercise them.

If the upper arms remain idle there will be small play of the chest, insufficient expansion of it, and therewith a tendency to various forms of weakness. Such a mpn could do little to defend himself in a tussle, to swim efficiently, or hold his own in emergencies, such as escaping from a house on fire or from a shipwreck. Very simple exercise will soon remedy this failure, and place our townsmen at an advantage, with direct benefit to general health. Every Englishman is supposed to know how to use his fists on occasion, and, as a witty American has said, “He always carries them with him”; but if he cannot hit out well from his shoulder, he will be a poor match for a garroter or other wary assailant. The use of clubs, dumb-bells, single stick, and the excellent practice of boxing will supply the necessary development; while cricketing and rowing furnish the best correctives in summer time.

The object to strive after is to be sufficiently trained all over as to

Digitized by <^.ooQLe
-ti-

the muscles of the body, and no extraordinary efforts are needed to secure this much.

One harmful custom, now so prevalent, must be noticed. I allude to the too great use now made of omnibuses and tram-cars by townspeople.

I am sorry for any shareholder in such concerns, but I wish to say that nowadays many persons drive who would be far better if they gave themselves time to walk to and from their places of business, and made the effort to do it. I take it that an average citizen needs daily not less than six or seven miles of walking exercise, or its equivalent in other muscular effort. The jostle and haste connected with short railway journeys are also inadvisable, and much harm undoubtedly comes from the rush to catch trains after a hurried breakfast. You do not suffer here, I imagine, from underground railways in which an abominable atmosphere has to be breathed. We know too much of their evils in London, and those who are wise take care to use them as little as possible.

The fact is that townspeople need all the fresh air and muscular exercise they can possibly get. This occupies time, and as time is said to be money, exercise and air are treated as unproductive and unnecessary, albeit you may rest assured that your money may cost you too dear if you neglect your body and the inexorable demands of nature. I am speaking of the laws that apply to the majority of people, for one meets with individuals who appear to thrive fairly well without much air and exercise.

Women can better than men resist the necessity for these. I generally use this argument, however, to enforce the good old doctrine that women are intended to be “keepers at home,” while men “go forth to their work.”

I will next remark that often in the case of sedentary lives where plenty of brain-work is carried on, there may be an excellent appetite. The muscles may be but little used, but a well-worked brain demands plenty of food, and all appears to go on well. But very often under these conditions we meet with irritable brains, peevish tempers, and an unsatisfied mind, and the case lies in relieving the brain by way of muscular energy. In this way, as a rule, do we most often meet with the healthy mind in the healthy body.

There are many claims on a citizen's brain which do not effect a countryman’s. The life of a great town is intense, and every sense is exercised and quickened, the wits are sharpened, and the weakly go to the wall. New-comers from the country are sometimes little adapted to the new environments awaiting them in towns, and not seldom make shipwreck amidst them, both of their bodies and their souls. They may inherit capacity for such a measure of muscularity as their newly-sought pursuits can never supply ; they must work with their brains instead, and unless good influences are soon brought to bear on them, they may very rapidly begin a downhill course. For such persons an institute such as this may well prove a vast boon, encouraging them to muscular accomplishments which they are well fitted to excel in, and to find wholesome-minded friends. I am no believer in universal or free educa-

tion to furnish the highest guide to morals. I am old-fashioned enough, though not an old man, to believe in the good old god-fearing, even if not very dogmatic, teaching as the best guide to conduct, and I find much room nowadays for the inculcation of the wisdom of Solomon, I have no belief whatever in any melancholy puritanical environments or restraints for the active and happy lives of young people, for I have had a terrible, and no small, experience of them. I believe in robust training for body and for soul, for both, and not for one without the other. And I will boldly affirm that to supply sound physical, and that is mainly muscular, training to any young man or woman is to do a good half of the work that the most devout and saintly person could wish to see accomplished for their highest interests, both here and hereafter. I say this because I know that no excellence or regular practice in athletics is possible together with intemperance or uncleanness, and because I know that gross appetites and carnality only grow in unexercised and ease-loving bodies. Swine can well become fat with full troughs in a foul stye.

There is a great sense of satisfaction enjoyed by persons in a condition of training, and even a moderate degree of this special muscular fitness is worth securing. Here, according to the late Dr. Parkes, are some of the happy results : “A clear skin, a bright eye, a cheerful temper, easy and rapid movements of the body, improved breathing power, firm muscles which resist bruising, and increased recuperative power after injuries.” It needs small knowledge of an urban population to satisfy one that much yet remains to be done to reach a measure of healthiness approaching this, but I venture to promise to the majority of those who properly avail themselves of the advantages of this institute many of the good things just enumerated. They will hardly fail to make themselves better men, better Englishmen, and so surpass the average citizen of other countries. Not that muscular prowess is to generate undue pride or self-conceit, for strong men, knowing their powers, should be, and commonly are, both gentle and modest in their demeanor, and above all men are, and should be, the most chivalrous in the defence of the weak and of the gentler sex, the most unselfish and self-sacrificing.

—Three of the foremost authorities on gymnastics will celebrate their 70th birthday this year. They are Dr. Carl Euler, February 8 ; Dr. Alfred Maul, April 13, and Dr. Otto H. Jaeger, June 10. These gentlemen have made gymnastics a life-study and are well known, not only in Europe, but in America as well.

EXCURSION TO CALIFORNIA

OF THE NORTH AMERICAN GYMNASTIC UNION (TURNERBUND) ON THE OCCASION OF ITS BIENNIAL CONVENTION AT SAN FRANCISCO, JULY 4 to 7, 1898.

A cordial invitation is extended to all members of the Turner Societies and their friends to join the National Executive Committee and delegates from the different districts in a grand excursion to California.

We have obtained very liberal concessions from the passenger associations of the several railroad systems of this country and, at least, a single fare for the round trip is assured.

The Turners of the Pacific Coast are proud of the honor to receive the next National Convention of the Turnerbund in San Francisco. It is the first time in the history of the Turnerbund that this legislative assembly is to hold its deliberations in the land of the setting sun beyond the Rocky Mountains, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean.

For the members of our California Circuit it is a labor of love, a cheerful sacrifice of time and money, to make this affair such a success that it will long be remembered as an important event in the history of the North American Gymnastic Union.

All visitors may be assured of a warm, fraternal welcome. Their brief sojurn in the land of sunshine and flowers will undoubtedly make a lasting impression upon them, often to be recalled in future years as one of the brightest and pleasantest memories of Californian hospitality, enhanced by the genial climate of that beautiful land.

All those intending to join the excursion are requested to notify us in order that later specific information can be sent them.

LEHR, THE GERMAN GIANT.

August Lehr, the German cyclist, who is now in this country and will stay for some time in the pursuit of American records, is a remarkable man in more ways than one. He is probably the heaviest champion cyclist in the world. At the present time he stands six feet high in his stockings and weighs 207 pounds. He admits that he is a little bit over weight, but says that when he is in perfect condition he tips the scales at from 190 to 196 pounds.

Lehr’s career on the cycle path reads like a romance. He comes from a good family and a wealthy one. His father is a more than prosperous vineyard owner. August, when a boy, took up cycling for pleasure. He soon found that he was able to ride away from his companions with ease. And it was but a short time before he drifted to the race track. Here he rode rapidly to prominence and now occupies a position in Germany similar to that which Zimmerman had in America, and he is frequently called the Zimmerman of Germany.

NOTES AND REMARKS.

—The Chicago Branch of the A. A. A. P. E., recently formed, seems to be on solid feet now, judging from the interest taken by the physical training directors. Several meetings have been held lately. We are promised a detailed report.

—The recent* Intercollegiate Meet at Tatter sail's in Chicago was a pronounced success. The Chicago University carried off the honors in the field sports. For the first time gymnastics played an important part in the affair and here the University of Wisconsin proved to come out on top. It is a somewhat pitiable feature, though, that “Mind and Body” has to rely upon meagre newspaper reports for its account while so many were present who could have informed us of the interesting part in the contest. One thing seems to be sure, and we are proud of it, that the Turners are not any longer the only ones in this country who perform difficult exercises on apparatus and do them in perfect form. College students are picking up good things when they find them out.

—The Pennsylvania Branch of the A. A. A. P. E. held its annual meeting at the Drexel Institute, Feb. 26. Of the new officers Dr. Ehinger was elected as president. The society will have monthly meetings.

—We are in receipt of the Rules of the Gymnastic Teachers’ Institute of England. For want of space we shall make our readers acquainted with this new institution in our next issue,

TO CLASS LEADERS AND ACTIVE MEMBERS OF SOC'S.

Under this column we would like to publish your opinion upon practical subjects.

We will gladly revise articles and withhold names if so desired.

Come forward with your opinions and experience, all of you.

QUESTIONS.

1.	Is the re-introduction of the voluntary apparatus in our class competitions, as recommended in our newly revised Festival Rules, an improvement over the former three field-sport exercises, or not ?

2.	Has the recommendation, to give from one to three points for the selection of such a voluntary apparatus, according to the difficulty of its use, any redeeming features, and what are they ?

Mr. Editor In the recommendation of “Old Timer” in your February issue about the future lodging and boarding of our active turners at large festivals, I can not but admire the old man’s business sagacity. It’s all business—too much business, and no fun. To stay in the festival camp for three days and nights, turning in early and not daring to play with pillows or eots for fear of the expense, and to practically see nothing of the festival city and its people until all work is ended, would not suit me and many other actives, who go to these festivals mostly for the fun there is in them.

—The A. A. W. is making a strong endeavor to come into relaion to so called amateur base-ball. It is a well known fact by those who are in touch with the game, that it is almost impossible to secure either a pitcher or catcher of any ability who will play the game without a money consideration. This ha* introduced into the game that professionalism \ihich always degrades it. Where professionals masquerade under the cloak of amateurs, evil constantly re-ults. The A. A.

WATER POLO

By F. S. LA RUE.

JMjtATER polo is a very popular game throughout the east and in other places SV where facilities are to be had for playing. A natatorium of medium size, or not to exceed seventy-five in length, a pair of goal posts, and a rubber ball eight inches in diameter are necessaiy to the game. The goal posts are erected in the middle of each end of the natatorium, the uprights being ten feet apart and the cross bar three feet above still water. The ball is inflated four-fifths of its size, thus giving the players opportunity to grasp it with a single hand. When the ball is passed between the uprights and under the cross bar, above or upon the surface of the water, a goal is scored. The contest is decided by the scores thus made in twenty minutes playing time. Teams consist of six men each.

At the beginning of the game the players line up at each end of the natatorium, and at a signal the referee tosses the ball into the center of the tank and the teams take to the water. Then begins the lively tussle and passing which continues for ten minutes. After an intermission of ten minutes the remaining half of the game is played, the sides changing goals.

The game is good for a general development, and it is gratifying to note its growth.

BOOK REVIEW.

—“Outing” for March opens with “The Fox Terrier,” a finely illustrated article by Ed. W. Sandys. The author ranks the intelligent, nimble terrier as one of the most desirable of canine companions. Other notable features of an excellent number are: “Hunting the Fur Seal,” by W. G. Emery; “The Southern Yacht Club of New Orleans,” by Lorillard D. Sampsell; “A Naturalist in Nicaragua,” by J. Crawford; “A Week with the Singhalese,” by E. M. Allaire, and “The Fitting Out of a Yacht,” by A. J. Kenealy.

—A Hand-Book of Wrestling. By Hugh F. Leonard, Instructor in Wrestling at the New York Athletic Club. Edited by Frederick A. Fernald. New York, E. R. Pelton, 129 Fifth Ave., 1897.—An excellent book. It contains 220 illustrations, the finest we have yet seen in any book on physical training. Preceding the positions, etc., there is a history of wrestling, and as a wind-up a chapter on the different styles of wrestling. We wonder why no mention is made of the style of wrestling as practiced in the Austrian Alps, which is entirely different from any other wrestling elsewhere. There the fall does not determine the contest; on the contrary,just then wrestling proper is beginning. The question, namely, is, Which man remains on top on the (soft) floor? A man either remains at the bottom, or he finally manages to get on top when exhaustion compels the pinned-down party to give up. No referee is necessary. This most natural determination of a contest we see practiced also in our country among school-boys. It permits resorting to a great many tricks which make up quite a little science. Mr. Leonard’s book is highly commendable.

Publishers: The “Gymnast” and Athletic Review, London.*—This book, although smaller, is gotten up somewhat in the fashion of Happel’s Exercices du Corps; even some of the illustrations bear a striking resemblance to Happel’s. It forms a very valuable storehouse of information for class leaders and teachers inasmuch as it embraces the whole field of instruction and contains excellent series of exercises and compilations just ready for application in any gymnasium. Some of the chapters are entitled: Hints to Leaders, Rules for Conducting Classes, Duration of Exercises, Dimensions of Apparatus, Breathing Exercises, Marching, Dumb-Bell

—	Under the present condition of affairs regarding athletics in England and the United Slates, it is impossible to make a correct comparison of records. In America the track is measured 18 inches from the curb, while 12 inches is the rule in Englznd. The British weight throwers get up the'r momentum in a nine-foot citcle. The athletes of the United States are restricted to seven feet. The English run over hurdles fixed firmly in 0 e ground, which is much more dangerous to the competitors than the lightly construct d and loose hurdles used in the United StatesBoston Herald.

—The League of American Sportsmen has recently been organized, the aim of the association being “to promote good fellowship among sportsmen 10 foster in the minds of the people a taste of nature and of naiure’s work; to encourage the propagation of game and game fish and the restocking of game fields and public waters.”

—Vale’s basket ball team was disqualified recently for playing in unsanctioned games.

—Hereafter “Mind and Body” should go hand in hand at the Univ. of Pa. for it ha- been announced that a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, George 11.

-	Bicycles are now carried as baggage without extra charge on American railroad lines aggregating over 68,000 miles in length, an increase of about 30,000 miles since February 1897. Coast line and river steamers and ferries having a combined length of route of 136,000 miles are also carrying bicycles the same as other fo^ms of baggage and without extra ■charge. The principal coast line steamers on both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts are included in this list, and all the big Tianspacific lines to China, Japan, and Australia are in line with the same policy. In France all railroads carry bicycles as ordinary baggage, and the increase of receipts within the last year, due to wheelmen s patronage, has been very substantial. The same effect is noted m this country as shown in the case of the Long Island Railroad Company, which in 1896 carried about 30,000 cyclist passengers, and last year about 150,000, each paying a full first-class fare.—Chicago Record.

-	D. D. Bici^ham is now business manager of ihe Dayton, O , Journal. R. C. Kimler is in business in Dayton, Ohio. Francis A. Lane is studying medicine in St. Louis, Mo. A. C. Tyler is studying architecture at Columbia College. This quartette was a very important factor in Princeton’s athletics at various times.

—Interesting matters are occuring in the A. A. W. Negotations are being conducted looking to the holding of expensive athletic sports a the Paris Exposition in 1900 in conjunction with the International Olympian Committee. It is hoped that a team will be sent from this country at the expense of the A. A. W. The president of the International Olympian Committee, Baron Pierre de Couberiin, is active in pushing these games. He is making a tour of Budapest St Petersburg, and Berlin, to see the presidents and members of the Hungarian, Russian, and Olympian Committees about these matters. It is possible that the third quadrennial set of games will be held in New York City in 1904.

-	On April 2nd, the Knickerbocker Athletic Club will give the cross country A. A. W. championship The gymnastic championship was given by the same club on March 9.

—Base-ball championship has been established in the Metropolitan Association.

—The Elm City Gaelic Athletic Association of New Haven, Conn., has been suspended by the L. A. W. for holding unsanedoned bicycle games.

—By virtue of the affiliation with the A. A. W. they will be given no more sanctions for athletic games until the L. A. W. removes the suspension.

—The Athletic Records Committee of the A. L. N. A. for 1898 has been appointed. It consists of Dr. P. C. Phillips of Amherst College, Mr. C. E. Patterson, and Dr. Luther Gulick.

—Dr. Luther Gulick of the A. A. U. registration committee recently attended two meetings, one in Boston, and the other in Philadelphia, for ihe purpose of explaining the registration of basket ball teams. At the Boston meeting about fifteen teams had representatives, only one of which teams was properly registered. AU agreed upon the desirability of registration, but each seemed to be waiting for the step to be taken by others. All these teams probably will be registered very soon. The meeting at Philadelphia was much larger and revealed a rather bal state of basket-ball affa rs. It seems that the city of “brotherly love” is a hot bed of professionalism. Little true amateur spirit is shown. The few who are m the game in that city for the love of the game itself, and not for some selfish purpose, are such a small minority that little amateur basket-ball can be hoped for there. If any place needs the registration rule Philadelphia does.
