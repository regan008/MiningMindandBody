FREE MUNICIPAL BATHS IN BOSTON.

By WILLIAM I. COLE.

(Concluded.)

THIS Seaside Bath, opened in 1866, was the first municipal bath established in the United States. A long, low frame structure provides a* great number of dressing-rooms and an adjoining building is fitted up with hundreds of lockers for the use of boys. These buildings, together with a high board fence at either end, extending well out into the water, effectually shut in the bath from all outside observation. By a special traditionary privilege, bathing-suits need not be worn at this particular bath, and thousands of men and boys, of all sorts and social conditions, disport in the water or lie stretched out on the sands in entire nudity at this place every day throughout the summer.

Farther along on the beach is a bathing-place for women and girls, three good-sized plain wooden buildings furnishing the neceesary dressing accommodations.

Next in point of popularity to the L Street Bath is the recently-opened bath at the Harbor-side Park at the North End. This affords a greater variety of attractions. A flat roofed, solidly constructed building runs along the westerly side of the park and contains the dressing quarters for men and boys. The top of this structure was designed

originally to serve as an elevated walk conducting to the upper deck of a great promenade pier that bounds the park at the harbor line, and encloses a little cove that makes in from the harbor. At present, however, the second deck of the pier is reached by steps leading up from the ground. Across the cove, on the easterly side of .the park is a bathhouse for women and girls, so that bathing in the open cove is permitted to both sexes at the same time, the accommodations being entirely separate. Another pier borders the easterly, side of the park, a channel between the two piers connecting the cove with the harbor. The shore of the cove forms a beach, where hundreds of children play in the sand. Commercial Street, with its ceaseless stream of travel and business, bounds the Water Park on the south. Across this street a series of three terraces leading up to the historic Copp’s Hill Burying-ground forms a picturesque background to the whole. From the middle terrace a bridge is called for in the original plan, to cross Commercial Street, and continue in the elevated walk, already described. As yet the bridge has not been built, on account of a proposed elevated railroad along Commercial Street.

Orchard Park, Roxbury.

While the North End beach, like the L Street Bath, attracts people from all parts of Boston and vicinity, the greater proportion of its vast throngs come from the densely-crowded tenements of the North End. A more cosmopolitan assemblage than gathers here it would be difficult to find. Every country of Europe is represented, and no less than fifteen

languages are to be heard. Five thousand bathers in a single day, besides a multitude of spectators, is not an uncommon number.

The other beach baths are at Wood Island Park, in East Boston, at Charlestown Heights, where there is a public playground, and at Commercial Point, Dorchester. The first two were opened last summer, and all three are much smaller and of a more strictly local character than those described.

Of the thirteen floating-baths, six are exclusively for men, five for women, and two are used for both sexes at different hours. They differ one from the other in the class of patronage they receive. The two on West Boston Bridge, for instance, are visited bv numbers of negroes from the large colored colony in the vicinity on Cambridge and the lower parts of Joy Street. Those on Craigie and Warren Bridges are the resorts, the one of the Jews from the Jewish quarter of the West End, the other of the fews and Italians from the North End. At Craigie Bridge the Jews constitute about one-third of the entire attendance. Many Italian mothers come to the women’s bath on Warren Bridge to wash and dress their infants. Dover Street Bridge Bath has a patronage almost wholly Irish in character on account of its nearness to the great Irish districts of the South End and South Boston. All of these baths situated as they are on thoroughfares between the city proper and great outlying working-class quarters are visited by very many laborers on their way to or from their places of work; not a few stopping habitually for a dip. A total attendance of one thousand during the day is not unusual at any one of them.

A new style of floating-bath has been recently devised by one of the Bath Commissioners which in several respects is a distinct advance upon that in use up to the present time. The tank of this house is left open to the sky, thus ensuring perfect ventilation and facilitating the drying of the floors and walls of the whole interior. Runways extending along either side and fitted with lockers, are substituted for dressing-closets,— one runway for adults, the other for children. A house of this description may be seen at Harvard bridge.

The Swimming-Pools were established to supply summer-baths to the

sec ti on s of the city without water frontage. One of the pools is at Orchard Park, a small open space with grass and trees in the midst of the tenement district of Roxbury. It consists of a tank made of concrete, eighty feet in length by thirty feet in width and four feet in depth to which fresh water is supplied from the city pipes. This tank is enclosed merely by a high board fence. Two or three polling-booths temporarily fitted up for the purpose afford the necessary dressing accommodations. Great care is taken to keep the water clean; the surface is drawn off several times daily, and once each day the tank is completely emptied and washed out. Every bather before entering the pool must use the shower-bath. Between eighty and ninety thousand gallons of water are used daily. This bath is the especial delight of children, who crowd to it in hundreds, but is patronized also by a good number of adults, especially in the evening. As jn the case of the floating-baths used by both sexes but not having separate accommodations for each, the bathing-hours are divided between men and boys, women and girls.

The other swimming-pool is on Cabot Street, also in Roxbury. Unlike the Orchard Park Pool, this is under cover. The building which it occupies was put up originally as a bath-house, but had not been used as such for a long period before it was re-opencd a few months ago.

A striking illustration of the local use of public bathing facilities is furnished by the fact that although these two swimming-pools are but a mile apart, the attendance of the older pool at Orchard Park did not appreciably fall off when the newer pool at Cabot Street was opened, the latter creating its own patronage.

In the equipment and management of Boston’s free municipal baths a special point is made of securing the patron’s comfort and safety, as well as enjoyment. Seats are provided for bathers and friends, ice-watcr is at hand for the thirsty, and at two or three of the larger places bicycles can be checked without charge. At the North End Beach a large awning tent affords shelter from the sun. To meet certain slight emergencies that may arise, surgical cases are provided, containing among other things, liniment for bruises, Jamaica ginger to be given in ease of cramp, ammonia to restore from fainting, and bandages for cuts and sprains; and the attendants are instructed in the use of these simple remedies and appliances. As a safeguard against accident by drowning at the beaches, trained life-savers in boats keep constantly near the bathers, both to render any needed assistance and to prevent the swimmers from venturing out too far. Other attendants also patrol the shore, ready to plunge into the water at a moment’s notice to bring a helpless bather to land. Stretchers are at hand to be used in cases ot need, and certain employees have been trained to resuscitate the apparently drowned. To these and other similar precautions must be due in large measure the almost complete exemption of the baths from ■serious accidents of any kind. Fatalities are practically unknown. During the last summer not a single bather was drowned. This is the more remarkable when the enormous number of people using the baths is taken into account.

Courtesy to all comers on the part of the employees, at all times

and under all circumstances, is strenuously insisted upon by the department. The general direction to superintendents and assistants is: “Regard as your guest every one who comes, and treat him as such.” To make patrons of the baths feel still more at home, attendants are taken, as far as practicable, from the neighborhood of the bath-house where they are to serve. At the North End Beach the leading nationalities also of the bathers are represented among the employees. Those who have

been a long time in the service know by name hundreds of the bathers, and in not a few cases are in friendly personal relations with them.

From the first, the actual use of Boston’s municipal baths has been absolutely free to the people. A fee of five cents is charged to adults for the use of bathing-suits, except at the North End Beach where suits are furnished free. Children’s suits may be had at all the baths without charge. One cent is the price for a towel everywhere. Bathers are permitted to bring their own suits and towels, if they care to do so.

Formerly the supplies of bathing-suits and towels were owned by the superintendents, who derived from their rental an income in addition to their salaries. At the beginning of the season just past, however, the city purchased the stock on hand and added to it in order to meet the increased demand. Its possessions in these lines at present are represented by 1,200 girls’ one-part suits; 1,200 women’s suits in two parts; 1,800 men’s two-part suits; 1,200 men’s trunks and 3,600 boys’ trunks for the floating-baths ; and 15,000 towels.

Probably no form of physical exercise combines so many admirable features as swimming. As a mere sport it has few rivals. When to this be added as incidental cleanliness and the ability to save life, swimming takes on a character of practical value. To bring this desirable accomplishment within the reach of all, especially school children, instruction in swimming was given at all the baths for the whole or part of last season. In preparation for this, as well as to connect the baths more directly with the city’s system of popular education, the head instructor in swimming visited the public schools before the close of the school year and taught the children the swimming motions. Toward the end of the season a series of “swimming events” took place at several of the baths, participated in by the boys and girls who had learned to swim during the summer. Gold, silver, and bronze medals, bearing the seal of the City of Boston, had been offered for the different contests. These prizes were handed to the winners by the Mayor.

The new bath-house whose erection was provided for by the Mayor early in his first term of office has been completed and was opened with . appropriate exercises on the fourteenth of last October. Its location was admirably chosen for the purpose in view. Dover Street, on which it faces, is part of a thoroughfare crossing the city east and west froip one extreme end to the other, and bisecting that district of the South End which is rapidly becoming the great metropolitan poor quarter of Greater Boston. Washington Street and Harrison Avenue, also great highways of travel running north and south, pass one within two blocks of the bath-house, the other within a single block. Those multitudes of people from all parts of the city and the outlying districts are brought daily into its neighborhood.

The building is a simple but imposing structure 48 feet wide by 110 feet deep. The front, which is three stories in height, is constructed of granite up to the second story, and of gray mottled brick with limestone trimmings from this up to the ornamental cornice of the roof. There are two entrances, one for men and one for women. Above these a row of three arched windows extends across the second story. On the first floor are separate waiting-rooms for men and women, together with the laundry and engine-room in the rear. On the second floor are separate bath-rooms for men and women. The third floor in the front part of the building contains an apartment for the manager of the baths and his family. The interior of the waiting-rooms and bathing apartments have a high wainscoting of Knoxville marble and the partitions of the baths are of the same material. The floors are of terazzo mosaic.

There are thirty sprays and three tubs for men, and eleven sprays and six tubs for women. All the baths are enclosed. Each shower-cabin contains a dressing-alcove, with seat. A Gegenstrom apparatus is used, which permits the bather to regulate the temperature of the water to suit himself. Both bathing apartments have toilet-rooms connected with them. The steam supply for all purposes is furnished from the boiler-room of the fire department repair shop, situated just at the rear of the bath-house lot.

The washing for all the winter-baths is done by the laundry in this building. In the summer season this work will be divided with the other municipal laundry at the North End Park.

In the planning and construction of the Dover Street bath the aim was to provide such a bathing establishment as would not only be in keeping with the dignity of the city, but would constitute a worthy centre for the proposed system of all-the-year-round baths. At present one other permanent bath is in operation. This is in connection with a gymnasium, and is situated in East Boston. The building, originally a skating-rink, was purchased by Mrs. Daniel Ahl, a number of years ago, enlarged, equipped as a combined gymnasium and bath, and turned over to the East Boston Athletic Association for the use of its members. In 1897 it was presented to the city and thrown open to the general public. The main hall is 100 feet long and 80 wide, and is well supplied with gymnastic apparatus. One corner may be shut off by movable partitions for hand-ball. There is a running-track, with twenty laps to the mile. Across one end is a gallery for spectators. In the bathiug department there are eleven unenclosed sprays, with the necessary dress-

ing-quarters and lockers. Two days a week the entire building is reserved for the exclusive use of women and girls. On these days the baths are separated one from the other by rubber curtains.

Medical directors are in attendance at certain hours to make bodily examinations and prescribe courses of training. A female medical director is employed for the women. Instruction in physical exercises is given classes of school children several days a week. Gymnasium suits are furnished by the city. These consist of the summer bathing-suits, supplemented in the case of the boys’ trunks with white knitted shirts.

Two more combined baths and gymnasiums are about to be opened,

one in South Boston and one in the . South End. Connected with the former is an area of cleared land containing about five and a half acres, under the control of the city, which in the near future will be laid out

with separate athletic fields for men and women. The structure itself is of wood, 75 by 100 feet, in the English Gothic style of architecture. An elevated running track extends around the interior. All the gymnastic1 apparatus is so arranged that it can easily be drawn up or pushed aside, leaving the floor entirelv free from obstruction. There are 1,200; lockers and 18 Gegenstrom spray-baths. The entire cost, including] furnishings, heating appliances, and the adjoining brick boiler-house, did not exceed $28,000. A^swimming tank under a separate roof is a part of the original plan, and in time will be added.

For the Sojjth End gymnasium and bath, Shawmut Chapel, a large, one-story brick building has been purchased. Here the lockers and sprays will be placed in the basement, the entire ground floor being given up to the exercise hall and superintendent’s office.

A similar institution, re-enforced in some cases by a swimming tank, is projected for each of the other three or four industrial districts of the city. Pending the erection of suitable buildings, the experiment will be tried of fitting up the wardrooms in these sections with gymnastic apparatus and baths which can-easily be removed whenever the rooms are needed for other purposes. The first of these temporary gymnasiums will soon be Opened at Roxbury Crossing.	#

For school children a system of special bathing facilities in the

—273—

school-houses is proposed, to be under the direction of the School Board. A beginning has already been made in the Paul Revere School at the North End, where a number of baths are in successful operation.

When thirty years ago Boston was considering the matter of providing public bathing facilities, there were no undertakings of the kind in this country for its guidance. Examples had to be sought in England and on the Continent. Since that time a number of American cities and towns have made more or less advance in this direction. But the best examples of municipal action in providing cheap and ample bathing are still to be found abroad, notably in Birmingham, Liverpool, London, Berlin, and Vienna. And yet the municipal system of baths in English and Continental cities lacks the democratic character that it must have in this country. To some extent the baths abroad preserve social distinctions by providing first, second, and, in some cases, third-class baths. In no case are the foreign baths free.

There is a contention in this country that those using public bathing accommodations should pay for the privilege in order to preserve their self-respect; but it is hoped in Boston that in due time the people will come to have something of the same ennobling feeling of ownership and responsibility as to baths which they already entertain with regard to the city’s schools, parks, and libraries.

EXTRACTS FROM EUROPEAN JOURNALS ON PHYSICAL

TRAINING.

By W. A. OCKER. M. D.

—Fete Gymnastique. On June 3d and 4th France will celebrate her 24th National Gymnastic Festival in the Exposition Grounds. The President and his cabinet will be guests of honor. The International Meet of World’s Championships will be held on July 29th and 30, at the Exposition.

—Pestalozzi Monument. As a token of esteem and remembrance Zurich has erected a most beautiful monument in honor of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. The figure, resting on a massive base of granite, represents Pestalozzi, bareheaded and dressed in a long coat, leading a ragged, tired, and hungry street-gamin by the hand.

—School-Doctors. The magistrate of Koenigsberg requested the appointment of ten physicians with a pay of 600 Mk. annually. It shall be the duty of these physicians to look after the health of the school-children and to advise and lecture the teachers on all questions of hygiene. Pupils shall, as soon as possible after enrollment, be examined as to their health and physical condition. The doctor shall decide as to whether or not a pupil ought to be excused from any part of the school curriculum (such as gymnastics, singing, etc.), and if anyone seat is more desirable than another (as in case of deafness or nearsightedness). Each child shall be furnished with a written or printed report as to its health and this report must accompany the pupil from one year’s class to the next. The doctor is required to meet the pupils at stated intervals and in all suspicious cases a rigid examination must follow. The school-doctor shall not be required to treat the sick children, but he must send them to their parents with a note explaining the nature of the illness. The school-principal, the building inspector and the doctor shall inspect each school-building twice a year and shall pay especial attention to the lighting, heating, and ventilating of the rooms.

—Jalm-Fest. There is a movement on foot in Berlin to establish a festival in honor of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, the so-called “Father of Gymnastics.’’ These festivals are to occur in those years in which there is neither a national nor a district festival. The Jahn-Fest is to be celebrated during the latter part of August or the fore part of September. The gymnastic program shall consist of a march (parade) of all participants to the “Fest-Platz,” competitive exercises and games. The winners are to be rewarded with either diplomas or wreaths df honor.

—Mummelis. In a little village called Weyersheim the farmers of the surrounding country meet occasionally to indulge in a simple but odd game called “Mummelis,” which consists in “butting heads.” Not only the skull but any part of the head, such as mouths, nose, or eyes, is open to attack. There are no special rules governing the contest and there are no prizes. The only condition is to “bump the other fellow harder than he bumps you.” In spite of all bruises etc. the contestants depart in the best of humor and friendship.

—Money Prizes. Owing to the speculative character which some of the wrestling meets in Switzerland are assuming, the Central Committee of the “Eidgenossische Turnverein” made following recommendations:

1.	To declare the offering of money prizes at festivals as unconstitutional.

2.	To forbid the members of the league to participate at any festival where money prizes are offered.

3.	To forbid the arranging of festivals with money as prizes.

Comments on above recommendations are numeorus, but most people seem to agree that the gymnast’s desire to attend a festival should be instigated by a higher motive than the winning of a prize and especially a money-prize.

Managers of pleasure resorts in Switzerland often arrange wrestling contests and, in order to draw a large attendance of both competitors and visitors, offer a cash prize to the winner. This custom has a tendency to demoralize, and our gymnastic brethren are trying to break this custom.

The question is a hard one to solve, for, as is the case here in America, if you do not educate the contestants and inspire them with the lofty ideals which we value so highly, they are apt to leave the ranks only to join an athletic or sporting club which offers gold medals etc. to the successful winners.

—MUCOUS Membranes. Following rules are recommended for inuring the mucous membrane:

1.	Thoroughly cleanse teeth and pharynx with luke warm water after every meal.

2.	Cleanse teeth with cool or cold water upon arising as well as when retiring. Gargle thoroughly.

3.	After gargling emit water through the nose.

4.	After every cleansing scrape the tongue with the teeth of the upper-jaw.

5.	Breathe through the nose only.

6.	Don’t partake of hot victuals. Do not tolerate steaming dishes on your table

7.	Don’t cover the neck with mufflers etc., keep it free.

8.	Strengthen the entire s>stem by taking a daily sponge bath with cold water.

—Gymnastics in Japan. In the schools of Japan, gymnastics, taught according to the German system, is rapidly gaining favor. Even the lowest classes receive instruction in physical culture. In the elementary grades, 10—15 yrs., gymnastics is considered a very important branch of studjr; during the first three years each class receives three, and during the last two years each class receives five lessons a week. In the higher classes, 15—19 yrs., the program calls for six lessons, thus ranking as the most important branch of instruction. The gymnastics consists of calisthenics, tactics, and apparatus work. The Japanese lay great stress on military drill. The pupil begins with the “School of the Soldier” and finishes with the “School of the Bataillon.” Besides this the male students of the upper classes practice sharp-shooting and are given special instruction in “Duty of Field Officers.

OUR SEVENTH YEAR.

WITH this issue “Mind and Body” terminates its sixth year of existence. Looking backward we can proudly say that under ' trying circumstances, sometimes suffering severely from the indolence of those directly connected with physical education, we have outlived the diseases peculiar to infancy and are to-day on a more solid footing than ever before.

The interest taken in our monthly seems to have increased if the list of subscribers can serve as a criterion.

Our publication is far from being perfect or complete, but we are doing the best we can under the conditions and are endeavoring to improve wherever improvement is in our power.

Suggestions in this direction are always welcome.

To those that have faithfully assisted in our efforts we extend our heartiest thanks, hoping at the same time that still more of our friends and readers will become active collaborators for the ensuing seventh year of “Mind and Body.”

OBLIGATORY WAND-EXERCISES

FOR THE 28th FESTIVAL OF THE N. A. G. U., TO BE HELD IN PHILADELPHIA IN JUNE, 1900.

Arranged by RICHARD PERTUCH, Technical Director of the Festival.

To the Societies of the N. A. G. U.

Gut Heil !

IN obedience to the Technical Executive of the N. A. G. U. I submit . to you the Mass Exercises for the 28th Gymnastic Festival, to take place in Philadelphia from June 20th until 23d, 1900.

They have been compiled with the aim of developing a uniform bodily activity, which will serve as a means to enhance physical education without overtaxing the memory to any great degree.

It is desirable that the societies should faithfully work on these exercises and that all active members should devote themselves to this task with zeal and joy. Through exact and vivacious execution, the total effect will offer a true and characteristic picture of our German “Turnen” and will form the climax of the entire festival. Let us hope for this.

EX PLAN ATORY REMARKS.

The hand-apparatus to be used in these exercises must be a nickel-plated iron wand, 42 inches in length, weighing 5 pds.

The exercises are divided into four groups, every group into four exercises and every exercise into four movements. Two beats are counted for each movement. The execution of the movement occurs on the first of these two beats. Every exercise is performed twice left, then twice right. In the description of the exercises the third and fourth movements are not mentioned, since the third is but a return to the first position, and the fourth leads back to the starting position.

As to the formation and the distance no definite plan can as yet be presented, the ground for the Mass Drill not having been decided upon.

During the formation the wand is to be carried against the right shoulder.

The starting position, which is low in front, is reached by bringing the left hand directly to the upper end of the wand, grasping it from behind and then lowering it in front. The accompaniment for the exercises consists of four different musical compositions, each of these pieces has 16 beats as introduction and 128 beats for the exercises of the respective groups.

The introduction of the second, third and fourth group is preceded by four extra beats.

Upon the ninth beat of the introduction for the first group, the left hand grasps the upper end of the wand, as above described, and upon the eleventh the wand is lowered in front. There will be 16 beats after the last group is finished, during which the wand is shouldered in the same way it was lowered. In all step positions the weight follows the stepping foot, so that it is equally divided on both feet. In the lay-out position the weight remains on the stationary leg. The distance between the heels in both of these positions is from 22 to 24 inches, and in the lunges 84 to 36 inches.

The first movement in the first and second exercise in the first group, where the wand is raised to the shoulders, the chest shall be elevated, and shoulders well back.

In the second movement the stretching of the arms shall be well marked.

Any further information which may be desired will gladly be given by Richard Pertuch, 2144 N. Natrona st., Philadelphia, Pa.

—Cremation. The Crematory Association of Zurich recently presented the City of Zurich with its entire plant. It also subscribed 6000 dollars towards the erection of a second crematory. Upon request any person dying within the city limits will be cremated at the city’s expense, whereas persons dying outside of the city will be cremated at the usual charge.
