A REVIEW OF SWEDISH GYMNASTICS.

Bv THEODORE HOUGH *

(Concluded.)

THE course of the day's order and the reasons for using each kind of movement at its particular time may then be given as follows:—

1.	Introductory Exercises.— Included under this head is a great number of movements which have previously been classified under order movements and leg movements. The term order movements really denotes the purpose rather than the character of the movement. They have been described as “intended to attract the minds of the pupils to the approaching gymnastic work; to induce them to assume that fundamental position and carriage best suited to the physiological interests of the body, from which other gymnastic movements start and to which they return before a relaxed position of rest is assumed." There can be no question that a large number of exercises do actually serve this purpose, and that the ordinary drill begins with them; and I can see no objection to the continued use of this term to indicate the purpose of many of the introductory commands of the day's order. On the other hand, as has been pointed out, the term does not describe the

character of the movement as do the others; nor do order movements Constitute a well-defined class of exercises. To the term leg movements I have two objections: it gives a false impression of the real character of the work, and it is connected historically with what is quite indefensible physiology. With regard to the latter objection, I have no intention of discussing the point here. The purpose of this paper is not to discuss what has been written about the Swedish system, but to describe what it is in actual practice on the floor of the gymnasium. I shall therefore confine myself to the statement of what is done during this part of the day’s order and the physiological results achieved thereby. As to the former objection, while it is perfectly true that leg movements are used and form a large percentage of the work done, yet it is also true that movements of the neck, shoulder, and arm are used often simultaneously with those of the legs. The former have, no doubt, been regarded as order movements, and, as used, serve this purpose; but they serve other purposes as well. The stretching of* the shoulder muscles, for example, which is the most prominent characteristic of the various “arm extensions,” has a very important corrective effect upon the form of the shoulder region; and, while it may be claimed that this is included in the statement about order movements that “they are intended the pupils to assume that carriage best suited to the physiological interests of the body,” yet we should then be compelled to include in the same category span-bend, heave, and back movements,— in short, all activities of limited mechanisms which correct faults of posture and carriage. Moreover, these leg movements would then not form, as a matter of sequence, a class separate from order movements; and, finally, the.movements of the upper extremities play their part— and a very considerable part it is—in the redistribution of blood, which has been improperly attributed to leg movements alone.

It seems to me that we should describe more accurately what is done by grouping both under the head of introductory exercises, which have two objects in view: first, to serve the general purpose of order movements; and, secondly, by calling into use the largest muscular masses of the body, to produce, without undue fatigue, some of the most important results of muscular exercise, among which may be especially noted a marked redistribution of the blood, more going to the working muscles and the skin and less to abdominal organs. Such work is not so specialized as that which immediately follows, apd for this reason is most suitable for beginning the lesson. Incidentally, it serves corrective purposes, both in the training of simpler motor mechanisms and also to some extent in co-ordination.

2.	Span-bending movements, which consist of certain backward flexions of the trunk which have the effect of straightening the thoracic region of the spine, of vaulting the chest forward, and of increasing the chest capacity and mobility of the ribs.

3.	Heave movements, which consist of various exercises in a hanging position and others which have the effect of expanding the upper part of the chest by lifting it upward. Incidentally, they also develop the arms and upper trunk muscles. Heave movements follow span-bending movements, because they are more vigorous in character; and it is

-99-

claimed that, as a matter of experience, they are apt to produce a certain amount of soreness in the abdominal muscles, which is for the most part avoided, if they are preceded by span-bending movements.

In these first three movements a considerable amount of work has been done, the intensity of the work increasing to a maximum in the heave movements. This work involves—indeed, is the result—of katabolic muscular changes which produce heat and discharge on the lymph and blood large quantities of waste substances. The body reacts to these conditions, and the general physiological results of exercise follow. These are directed primarily to getting rid of waste products; incidentally, they provide food and oxygen for the anabolic processes which at once begin to make good the loss of muscular fuel substance. In order to get rid of the heat, the cutaneous arterioles dilate, and the secretion of perspiration is greatly increased; these agents are aided by the increased volume of air heated in the lungs and the increased evaporation of water from the surfaces of the respiratory tract. The temperature of the blood rises slightly, though perhaps not more than a degree centigrade. In order to get rid of the carbon-dioxide, the breathing movements and the rate of the heart-beat are increased; the circulation through the lungs is consequently quickened, but it is a mistake to assume that the amount of blood flowing through all organs of the body is increased. In point of fact, the arterioles of the intestine, the kidney, and probably the liver and spleen, constrict, thus diminishing the blood-flow through them. It is probable, though not proved, that the blood-flow through the brain is usually somewhat increased, though at times it may be unchanged or even diminished. In all these vascular changes the cardiac, the vaso-constrictor, the vaso-dilator centres work together, so as to maintain the aortic pressure at the normal height or somewhat above it. The pumping action of the contracting muscles aids in the flow of blood and lymph away from them; and the augmented respiratory movements, by increasing the aspiration of the thorax aids the return of blood and lymph from all organs. Especially important is this effect upon the lymph-flow, since an increased lymph-flow from an organ means increased circulation of lymph in the tissue spaces around the cells, and hence a more equal and rapid distribution over the surface of the cell of the food material and oxygen derived from the capillaries, and a more effective return of waste products to the capillary wall for removal. Other organs are thrown into activity to complete the oxidation of certain katabolic products of muscular activity; and the presence of an increased amount of some of these products in the blood changes the chemical character of the blood, and so the environment of all cells of the body. It is, moreover, not improbable that, so long as these are not present in excessive amounts, the changes thus produced may favor the/ healthy life of other cells; muscular activity woijld, from this point of view, produce an internal secretion; but the matter needs further experimental study.

These are the general physiological effects of all muscular exercise, and their amount is proportional to the intensitv of the exercise taken. It is to them that the “freshening” effects of exercise are due. The movements of the extremities, span-bend movements, and heave move-

ments, therefore, in addition to the special corrective function which each performs, by calling into play large groups of muscles serve the additional purpose of “freshening up” the class without producing such fatigue as may interfere with the proper execution . of subsequent co-ordinative or corrective movements; and it is only after these are given that the general physiological effects are pushed to their maximum point of intensity in vaulting, jumping, running, and games.

In accordance with this plan we now pass to

4.	Balance movements, “which bring about a co-ordination of muscular contraction in all parts of the body, and by demanding equilibrium in difficult positions train the sense of correct and graceful posture.” Movements of the extremities, back and lateral trunk movements, and others involve co-ordination of muscular contraction in all parts of the body, and hence are to that extent balance movements. The training of the sense of equilibrium, in other words, is not confined to this part of the day’s order, but is merely its chief feature and special purpose.

Balance movements are introduced at this time for several reasons. They make an agreeable change in the nature of the work, which in the immediately preceding movements has been confined to activities of limited motor mechanisms; since more of these follow in the various trunk movements, a certain amount of monotony in the general character of the work is avoided. Moreover, no muscles important in maintaining equilibrium on the feet have been worked very hard; and hence, in the absence of local and general fatigue, finer co-ordinative work can be executed. Finally, balance movements throw most work on the leg muscles, and hence to a certain extent rest the trunk, which, having been concerned in heave movements, has still to perform those movements which involve the various flexions of the spinal column. When the various balance movements have once been learned, they are profitably introduced elsewhere, and especially where fatigue is present; their use in that case trains still more the sense of equilibrium in difficult positions. It is clear, however, that they should first be learned under the most favorable conditions before being used under unfavorable conditions.

The previous corrective movements of limited motor mechanisms have to deal with muscles which act upon the upper ribs or with their immediate antagonists. After balance movements we pass to a group,— (5) back, (6) abdominal, and (7) lateral trunk movements, which produce flexions of the spine (dorsal, ventral, and lateral). Such movements not only train the use of the muscles concerned, but are also the chief means of correcting and preventing faults in the growth of the spine. This is especially true of back movements, which also correct the carriage of the shoulder blades. In addition to this, abdominal and lateral trunk movements, “by alternating increase and decrease of abdominal pressure, favorably affect the work of the digestive organs.”

The comparatively short space devoted to the description of these three classes of movements does not indicate their relative importance in the day’s order. In point of fact, they are surpassed by no other class in corrective value. Through them we secure correct carriage of the trunk, depending as this does, upon the proper play of the great

-101-

groups of antagonistic muscles especially concerned in and strengthened by such movements; and it is the weakening of these muscles through disuse which is the chief cause of the tendency to “slump,” against which a recent magazine editorial enters a timely protest, as being all too characteristic of American life.

The order in which they are given is, for the most part, immaterial.

8. Vaulting, Jumping, Running, and Games.—These exercises at the same time command a high degree of co-ordinated muscular action and constitute the most severe work of the day’s order. The previous balance movements train the sense of what has been called “statical” equilibrium, or equilibrium of the body at rest. Vaulting and jumping, on the other hand, train the sense of “dynamical” equilibrium, or equilibrium of the body in motion, and in this case of motion which involves considerable muscular work.

It is hardly necessary to add that they are not features peculiar to Swedish gymnastics, and that they serve the same purpose, no matter by whom used. They form, in fact, an indispensable part of all gymnastic training. The greatest stress, however, should be laid on the proper execution of the movements. It is not, for instance, the height of the jump which is of importance, but the way in which it is carried out and the proper landing which follows. In addition to the co-ordi-native value of these movements, they, together with running and games, involve rather intense physical work, and produce in the highest degree the general physiological effects of muscular exercise already described. These effects are allowed to “approach, but never to exceed, the limit where breathlessness in its graver form sets in.”

9.	Slovv-leg and respiratory movements.—It is a well-known fact that, on stopping suddenly any very vigorous exercise, certain disagreeable symptoms are apt to result. These are characterized by a very evident heart-beat, at times grave breathlessness, and feelings of fulness about the head, in which the throbbing of the pulse can often be distinctly felt. Tkese symptoms are most pronounced immediately upon stopping,—at least it is at that time that they most affect consciousness. For the present it is sufficient to understand that at times symptoms of distress follow exercise, and that in practically all cases which do not involve actual exhaustion, these symptoms are much less pronounced— so far, at least, as consciousness is concerned—if we do not stop at once, but gradually pass from the more intense work through less intense forms to rest. This is a recognized practice in the care of horses. No jockey is allowed to stop a horse immediately after the finish of a race, and it is hard to believe that the popular impression that such a course is more or less apt to produce temporary or permanent injury to the animal is entirely without basis in fact. It cannot be said that all severe work is sure to be followed by symptoms of distress, nor need we be surprised to find that these symptoms may or may not appear under what seem at first sight identical conditions. In a class of twenty people, perhaps not more than half would show marked distress after a given run, for the simple reason that the same work may be severe * to one and easy to another; and in the same individual the same work may be severe one day and easy the next.

—102—

But, granting all this, it would seem a safe course to avoid this distress as far as possible; we do not know that it is always harmful; but it looks suspicious, and we certainly do not know that it is never harmful. The history of many pathological conditions of the heart and the circulation points too clearly to excessive muscular work as having to do with their causation to justify us in ignoring any warning that may accompany such work. It is lor this reason that the severe exercises of the day are immediately followed bv slow-leg movements (such as comparatively rapid marching), accompanied or followed by respiratory movements. The reason usually given for this—that “the accelerated action of the heart must be normalized” and “free respiration restored”— is unsatisfactory. The accelerated heart action will, in point of fact, come back to the normal it the organism be left to itself; and free respiration will also be restored. It seems much more accurnte to say that these movements afford very great assistance to the heart in maintaining an efficient circulation. They thus prevent distress, and hence, no doubt, danger, while the organism is adjusting itself to the changed conditions of rest.

As I have said, it cannot be claimed that these movements are necessary in all cases. They are probably unnecessary, for example, in very strong individuals, in whom vigorous work does not produce the cardiac acceleration seen in those not so strong; but they are advisable with the majority of people, and probably necessary with a large number. It must not be forgotten that the mission of gymnastics is not primarily to the athlete, nor is its chief purpose the training of athletes. In accomplishing the purposes of physical training outlined in the beginning of this paper, we have no reason to believe that the cultivation of great strength is necessary; nor, in view of the conditions of life Among people to-day, is it desirable. The athlete is as much a specialist as the student of Sanskrit literature; and the great muscular strength and bodily endurance under physical strain which is his specialty is no more necessary for the health of the business man or student than is a thorough training in astronomy or physics to the athlete as such. I am convinced that it is a mistake to attempt to cultivate a healthy sentiment for rational physical training among people generally by means of the athletic ideal alone. So far from encouraging the rational use of exercise by all, it certainly at times tends to discourage it, simply because the ideal is unattainable to the vast majority of men, and it is entirely out of place among women. The Swedes have avoided this error successfully. Without discouraging athletics, they recognize that the athlete is a specialist, and that there is a physical training needed by all classes,—by people who can never be athletes, the vast majority of whom react less rapidly and less perfectly to sudden changes in the state of the body as regards muscular activity than do those trained to the highest degree of physical endurance. Hence it is advisable with drill work with large classes “to warm up” to the more intense work more or less gradually, and not to pass immediately from this to rest.

Any account of the day’s order fails to do it justice which does not emphasize the element of progression so skillfully parried out. In each group of movements the student passes to those requiring greater

-103-

co-ordination and greater strength only after he can do simpler movements involving the same general groups of muscles. This is merely the principle of training, but nowhere is more attention given to it than in the system we are considering. Compare it, for example, with the method of giving directions to individual students for the use of apparatus for the next three or four months, and then giving new directions for more difficult work only after that time. The Swedish drill can stand this comparison and should invite it, for it is clear that only in drill work can any proper system of daily progression be carried out successfully in large classes; and daily progression in large classes is a thing which, it seems to me, we have a right to demand of any gymnastic work which professes to be physiologically correct and practically available.

The mere recount of these groups of movements of the day’s order certainly sounds uninteresting enough. In point of fact, it is only the skeleton upon which the system is built, and no more describes a day’s drill with a good teacher than does the humqjn skeleton betray the life of the human body. I have already said that a poor teacher can make a Swedish drill an insufferable bore. In fact, the ability to make gymnasium work attractive and interesting is absolutely necessary to any one who is to undertake that work. Swedish gymnastics will not be a success without this. But will any other gymnasium work be a success without it?

Critics of the system have made, it seems to me, two very great mistakes: one class has deluded itseh into thinking that it has criticised the system, when it has only criticised certain physiological or other statements which have been made about the system; another class goes no further than the skeleton upon which the whole thing is built, and then pronounces the system itself “as dry as bones.” Neither mistake would have been made, had the system been studied on the floor of the gymnasium and with reference to the aims which it seeks to accomplish.

In physical training two aims are pre-eminently important:—

1.	The general effects of bodily exercise, including the acquisition of that amount of physical endurance which the special conditions of each individual life demand. I place this first, for it is the chief object of physical training.

2.	Correction of physical faults, both deformities of the muscular and skeletal systems and deficiencies in the nervous control of the body. I have tried to show that this is rendered necessary by the specialization of life, and is especially necessary with that specialization which marks the period of development, and which may be summed up in the two words, “the school desk.”

The primar^ purpose of the Swedish system of gymnastics is the second of these objects. Its system of movements is based on a most careful study of kinesiology. It studies the effects of the innumerable possible movements upon the development of the body,—that is to say, upon form and carriage,—and it makes use of such movements as are known to be fitted to accomplish the corrective effects desired. It gives these movements in that way which will best insure with all members of the class their proper execution and greatest corrective value,—that

-104-

is, in the form of a drill and to the word of command; and it gives them with constant reference to such progression, both in the work of euch day and especially in the work of successive days, as to secure the effects of training without undue fatigue or strain.

It does not entirely satisfy the demands of the body for general exercise. No gymnasium work does. The Swedish system is not all of physical training; and, if some of its advocates have claimed that it is, such claims are merely the result of over-enthusiasm, and do not demand serious consideration. It starts with the assumption that corrective work is needed, and that this must be an essential part of all gymnastics; but it endeavors to give this in such a way as shall not sacrifice the more general hygienic effects of muscular activity. To what extent it accomplishes this depends largely on the teacher, partly upon the gymnasium facilities. It is not automatic: it will not succeed in incompetent hands; but, unless you are ready to deny the need of all corrective work in physical training, it does not demand qualities of its teachers other than those which all physical training requires.

We hear much to-day about the immense superiority of outdoor games to indoor gymnastic work; and there can be no doubt that in most, if not all, our American colleges for men there is a marked tendency away from the gymnasium. Nor need we be surprised at this. When gymnasia were first built at our colleges, the entire work of physical, apart from that of class and college teams, was confined to the gymnasium, which thus came to assume a rank of exclusive importance to which it was not entitled. Moreover, this gymnasium work has rarely, if ever, been under sufficient supervision. It is not too much to say that the American idea of a gymnasium has been an elaborate building with expensive apparatus, in which the innocent student in search of health might pull on various weights “with nervously exhausting and deadening monotony.” Such has been the experience of the majority of men who have tried such work, and the tendency to the exclusive use of games is simply the unanswerable proof of the failure\f the system. It is not a valid argument against well-directed gymnastics. In fact, both the gymnasium and outdoor games have special functions in physical training, and one cannot replace the other. On the contrary, one supplements the work of the other. For producing the general physiological results of exercise, outdoor work is immeasurably superior. Bicycle riding, canoeing, rowing, tennis, golf, skating, etc., not to mention the games of earlier life, should constitute and, as a practical matter, must constitute the chief means of physical training*; but, while they well serve these more general and more important purposes, they are not conveniently used at all times of the year, and they have only limited corrective value; they do not remedy faults of posture, of carriage, of gait; and those interested in physical training should see to it that the welcome increase of interest in outdoor exercise does not produce neglect of the corrective work which the gymnasium alone can give.

INTEMPERATE TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION.

With all due respect to Mrs. Mary Hunt the value of sobriety and a clean life are not best taught to a child through the agency of tables showing the percentage of alcohol in various intoxicating beverages, or of realistic colored charts exhibiting the gangrenous state of a delirium tremens stomach. We do not believe that it can be shown that this physio-chemical primary grade campaign against alcohol has an ounce of influence in deterring the average young man from acquiring the drink habit. The man, young or old, who drinks whiskey is not lacking in knowledge but in will. The doctors themselves generally drink more or less, and so do most of the ministers and school teachtrs when they leave their professions and go into business or politics.

It is social environments, not ignorance, that makes the drinker. Give a boy high ideals of self-respect and moral cleanliness, convince him that drinking and gambling and sporting and saloon and cigay store associations generally are low, disreputable, and altogether beneath the man who aspires to be a gentleman, and you do more to make him a clean temperate man than can be done by all the temperance physiologies ever written. In our judgment, if the time that is spent in having childrtn con long lessons about the composition of beer and champagne, or in showing them what whiskey will do to the white of an egg, or its effect when injected into the brain of a frog, were spent in getting them acquainted with the lives of Washington, Lincoln, Gladstone, Garfield, Emerson, Edison, and the long line of illustrious men who were too great to be vulgar and dissipated, it would be better both for the schools and the cause of temperance.— Learning by Doing.

THE GOLDEN JUBILEE,

THE BIENNIAL CONVENTION, AND THE RECENT NATIONAL FESTIVAL OF THE NORTH-AMERICAN TURNERBUND.

THE pioneer-organization for systematic physical training in America, the North American Gymnastic Union (Turnerbund) has arrived at the half-century mark and has celebrated this rather important event simultaneously with the Biennial Convention and the National Festival at Philadelphia from June 17th to 28rd. These combined festivities were bound to bring, a large number of turners, old and young, to Philadelphia.

There were a number of those present who fifty years ago helped in forming this organization and who have been interested in it ever since.

The so-called “Passive’' members assembled by the thousands, a number of them being elected delegates to the convention.

The main object of attraction, of course, were the active contestants, or “Actives” as they are styled, aggregating about two thousands from all parts of the country.

Although the National Republican Convention which took place at the same time detracted somewhat from the interest taken in the festivities, a large proportion of Philadelphia’s population turned out to see these 2000 men march in line through the principal streets. We are promised an exhaustive report on the Festival and will therefore confine ourselves to a short enumeration of the main events.

The Convention, which preceded the Festival, occupied the first three days and was in several respects quite interesting.

No fundamental changes, carrying with them importance for outsiders, have been made except that a resolution was passed to the effect that in the future both an English and a German course are to be opened in the Normal School. The next convention is to be held at Davenport, la., in 1902, the next festival in 5 years, the place to be decided at the next convention.

The program of the festival was very elaborate, so much so that it was impossible for one person to attend at every part of it.

The Exhibition at the Music-Hall was splendid in every detail, the Reunion of the Pioneers was well attended and brought forth a great deal of enthusiasm.

The Class- and Individual Contests proved that the North-American Turner-Bund is progressive as well as progressing, while the Mass- and Special-Class-Exercises were highly interesting to the large masses of the spectators.

While there is always room for improvement and some features lost in attractiveness in some details it must be acknowledged that this immense affair was managed in general with good judgment.

Prof. Richard Pertuch, the Director, and his untiring staff, as also the Festival Committee and the Technical Committee of the Bund deserve praise for their well-directed arrangements.

Financially the festivities were, as was expected, a failure although only to a very limited extent, the deficit amounting to about 500 or 600 dollars, a small sum if one considers that the expenses rose to somewhere about $25,000.

The following list contains only the 3 highest winners in some of the contests:

ANNOUNCEMENT.

Dr. W. A. Ocker, heretofore teacher of Physical Training at the Hughes High School, Cincinnati, 0., has, as was reported in one of our former issues, resigned that position and will in the future be connected with a large manufacturing establishment in St. Louis in the capacity of Assistant Superintendent. We regret that this change will deprive him of the necessary time to continue his well-appreciated work for “Mind and Body.”—Mr. Carl L. Schrader of the West Chester, Pa., Normal School, will be his successor in our Editorial Committee and especially continue the column “Extracts from Foreign Journals of Physical Training.”

NOTES AND REMARKS.

—The Board of Education of Atlanta, Ga.f has adopted physical training for the public schools of that city and appointed Dr. Theodor Toepel, a graduate of the Milwaukee N. A. 3. U. Normal School, as director for. this branch.

—The French Gymnastic Federation has recently celebrated its 4th National Festival in Paris. About 350 societies comprising 8000 gymnasts, besides many guests from other parts of Europe, took part in it. According to reports the Festival was a pronounced success throughout. The Festival had a very decided national and military character as is usual in France, the government being prominently represented. The French Republic contributes financially to these affairs.

—Quite a number of teachers of the N. A. G. U.'directly after the Philadelphia Festival journeyed abroad to “do” the World’s Fair in Paris and to see the French and Swiss Festivals at Paris and Geneve respectively.

BOOK REVIEW.

(.All the books mentioned under this head may be ordered from the Freidenker Publ. Co., Milwaukee.)

—Children rust in summer. ‘‘That children do rust out during the long summer vacation is unquestionably a fact,” writes Edward B. Rawson, in the July Ladies’ Home Journal. ‘‘That several weeks of the already too short school year must be spent in rubbing off the rust before the advance can be •resumed, all teachers know. But that is not the worst of it. When the rust is removed the former lustre is not restored. The child’s brain is not in a receptive condition: it has been allowed to rust. Children prefer regular employment, provided it be interesting. However glad they are when the last day of school comes they are quite as glad to resume their work in the fall even if its interest is not great. A boy—or more frequently a girl—will sometimes overwork, not because he is pushed, but because he is permitted. Very seldom will either a boy or a girl choose to do nothing. One may choose to do things other than those we require, and so be called idle or lazy; but to be doing something is the natural condition, and the condition that is preferred. So strong is the instinct to be active in both mind and body that when left to themselves our children will find something to do in spite of us, and too frequently it is something that might better not be done.”

— In the August number of THE DELINEATOR Dr. Murray handles very thoroughly a subject of great interest to mothers. The sudden attacks of croup with their very distressing symptoms, and the alarming dangers of diphtheria are treated with professional thoroughness, but in such a way that unprofessional people can understand and act upon the advice at the outset of an attack. Of similar aid and help to mothers in the same number is Miss Lina Beard’s very clever article on Pastimes for Convalescent Children. Parents who are thinking seriously at this time of the future of their growing daughters will find in the August number of THE DELINEATOR an article of great assistance by Miss Halstead on “Preparatory Schools.”

OUR ATHLETES ABROAD.

The American athletes who invaded Europe won golden victories.

best America can boast of, but they are very nearly representatives coming, as they do, from Princeton, Universities of Pennsylvania, Syracuse, Georgetown, Michigan, Chicago, and the New York Athletic Club. They seemed inferior to the athletes of the other nations only in the long distance running, a circumstance which is probably due to the fact that long distance running receives more attention abroad, where numerous clubs are devoted to the cross country running. The training of the Americans, too, has evidently been exceptionally good, for the athletes have not shown those signs of collapse which have hitherto prevented many American victories. It is said that the American athletes would have done even better yet than they did, had not some of them refused to compete on Sunday. On the whole, the Olympic Games were not the very greatest success from the point of view of amateur sport, and the fact that some of the events were handicapped would seem to show that an artificial stimulus, and not sport for sport’s sake, was needed to create an interest in the events.
