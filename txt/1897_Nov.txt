BICYCLING, WISE AND OTHERWISE.

By FRED. E. LEONARD, M. D.

(Concluded.)

BACK TO THE COUNTRY.

BEST of all, bicycling restores the dweller in towns and cities to his ancestral home, the country. It allows frequent escape from manmade streets and shops to the inimitable beauties of nature, to a larger horizon and unadulterated air, to the home of simpler manners and saner habits. After a few hours under the trees or hy the water’s edge, or in the midst of fields green with growing crops, or golden at the approach of autumn, conscious of odors beyond the skill of the perfumer, greeted by the innumerable sounds of bird and insect life, while overhead unseen hands are shifting the glowing scenery of the skies, one must be strangely unresponsive not to feel that he has been recreated, and filled with fresh vigor by the matchless tonic.

The spirit of adventure is aroused at the same time, and given an outlet. Near at hand there are many attractive places to be explored,, and the few weeks of vacation may carry one, at trifling cost, into-regions more remote, to picturesque scenes and strange communities. The wheel thus becomes a means of education, the'source of new and varied experiences which tend to develop physical hardihood, self-reliance, and the ability to cope with unexpected difficulties. The cyclist comes to know a country and its people far more widely than the pedestrian. At an expense of not far from two dollars a day, or half that sum on the continent, he may prolong his tour indefinitely, barring accidents, adding to his knowledge of men and affairs, and bringing home a lasting store of pleasant memories.

A CAUTION.

But if one wishes to obtain unalloyed benefit from the use of the wheel he must not overstep the bounds of moderation, nor must he forget that, like other good things, it has its abuses. Not all the evils urged against the practice deserve serious consideration. Some are imaginary or problematical, others are not dangerous, a few are of vital importance. The unsightly “scorcher” position is unnecessary rather than harmful, and the shock to the aesthetic sense of the looker-on is probably the greatest evil that attends it. To adopt such a crouching attitude, sinking the handle-bars almost to the level of the hnees and bending them in toward the frame, is of course to contract the chest and limit the mobility of its walls, since it compels the muscles of inspiration to work at a disadvantage. It is a deformity which must be attributed largely to the boyish ambition to look like a racer ; but the conditions which lead the latter to bend forward do not hold in the case of the ordinary wheelman, and for every-day riding the position is as needless and out of place as the jockey's stoop would be for a cavalry officer on parade. A reaction has already set in, but for a time it looked as though the labor of the ages of evolutionary change which had orought man to the erect position was to be undone by the general wish to copy the attitude of our ape ancestry. Bicycling, it has been truly remarked, is not so arduous an affair that he wrho undertakes it need put his shoulder to the wheel ; and many a one will echo the sentiment of Robert Grant’s lines in “Harper’s Weekly”:

“To us who view you scorching day by day,

Bent on your bar in such an awkward way,

You are the homeliest thing on earth, my lad !

Oh, sit up straight, and make the landscape glad!’’

Not the least undesirable feature of the position is its interference with any real appreciation of the scenes through which one is passing ; and this suggests one of the most widespread misuses of the wheel, the insane desire to “pile up mile on mile,” and to measure the success of an outing by the distance traversed in a given time, as though that had any but the remotest relation to its actual hygienic or recreative value. It is worth stopping to ask, for example, what one of the possible benefits enumerated above can be claimed by the great majority of riders who complete “century runs.” Not renewed vigor, for the exercise is pushed to the limits of endurance, strain takes the place of moderate stimulation, and the fatigue which follows more than counteracts the influence of sunlight and fresh air. Considered as a means of recreation it is no less palpable a fraud. To weariness from mental overwork in the office or the shop is added the weariness of physical overwork, and the two by no means neutralize one another. A fair amount of physical exercise is not only compatible with hard brain work, but is one of its prime conditions ; pushed beyond the point of moderation, however, the two cease to be reciprocally favorable. It is well known that the poisonous fatigue stuffs, which accumulate in the body and produce the unpleasant symptoms of over-exertion, are substantially the same in both eases, so that the attempt to remedy one form of excess by the other is like seeking to prolong the life of a candle by burning it at both ends.

FOOLISH RIDING.

The man who rides along a country road at a twelve-mile gait, never moderating his speed for a moment, or dismounting to linger over an unusually pleasing prospect, might as well be moving between bare stone walls, so far as any permanent impression from his surroundings is concerned. He looks upon wheeling as an end in itself, and fails to perceive its greater value as a means. Somewhat the same blunder may be charged to him who makes it a matter of principle, of pride, to stick to his saddle up the steepest hills and over the roughest roads, where walking would require only a fraction of the effort. Such a man (he is more likely to be a boy) puts a needless strain upon his muscles, and especially upon his heart, and though the latter may be sound and strong enough to endure the strain, yet common prudence should incline one to humor such a faithful and indispensable servant when it can be done so easily.

Occasionlly one meets a wheelman smoking as he rides. To the mind of the impartial observer the excesses of the confirmed tobacco-user are often surprisingly inconsistent with good judgment and good taste; but this one is certainly almost grotesque in its folly. When the system is calling for more oxygen and making attempts to secure better ventilation of the lungs, to answer it with smoke-tainted air is like giving a stone in place of bread, or a serpent for an egg. Much more might be said by way of caution, but if the cyclist will remember that the possession of a wheel does not render him any less liable to penalties for the infraction of familiar laws of health, physical or spiritual, he need not fear to use it to his heart’s content.—“A/en.”

Meeting of the Cleveland Branch of the A. A. A. P. E.

THE meeting was opened by Chairman Dr. C. Zapp. First on the program were talks on summer schools. Dr. Zapp gave short account of work done, and new features, also on number of scholars, teachers, and branches, taught in the Milwaukee school. Mr. Anderson made a similar report on the Chautaqua school.

Dr. L. K. Baker read a paper on “Plays.” The paper was excellent and will be read at the state meeting. The discussion was opened in the way of reports on games of the Y. M. C. A. by Mr. Kinnicut, on those of the turners by Dr. R. Fisher, and on college games by Dr. C. G. Lang. A general discussion followed in which many interesting points were brought out. Dr. Fisher introduced a resolution, instructing the council to formulate a petition to be read at the next meeting of the State Medical Society, calling for its assistance in the propaganda for gymnastics. Adopted.

It was also resolved that all members should attend the meeting of the Ohio Physical Education Association to be held at Dayton on November 26 and 27.	F.

THE IMPORTANCE GIVEN PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT THE CHICAGO NORMAL SCHOOL.

IT is very gratifying to notice the steady advancement in the line of studies in some of our best institutions of the subject of physical training. Interest in this fundamental branch of education increases with the growing cognition of its vital importance. The constant direction of attention to its inestimable value, as a factor in education, by those who are beginning to judge of its effects as students of education, not only augurs well for the future, but promises more real progress toward the wide-spread introduction and extension of gymnastics than all the spasmodic attempts heretofore recorded.

The study of the motor-side of education—of attention, of interest, of the development of will-power, the study of the relation of mind and body and body and mind, etc., in the light of results of recent psycho-physiological researches; of physical activity and mental development ; the value of motor-habits in the economy of action ; the study of motor-ideas as fundamental to all conscious volition, etc.; the widespread interest in games and plays, resulting in all the larger cities in the establishment and equipment of play-grounds—these and other discussions indicate a healthy and promising progress and interest, destined to become more and more profitable as these studies are directly associated with the work of physical training. Numberless problems await solution in this connection.

The physical training department of the Chicago Normal, formerly Cook County Normal School, has had exceptional advantages and opportunities in making possible an unusually exhaustive treatment of the subject of gymnastics, in that the theories and methods of the school assured from the very first the co-operation of all departments toward the one main purpose : the attainment of the highest possible standard of teaching power that existing conditions would admit. Toward this end fullest recognition and equal rank with all other departments was accorded the physical training department.

We hope in the near future to outline some of the characteristic work of this school so .favorable known throughout the length and breadth of the land. To-day we take the liberty to reprint from the monthly publication of the school, containing the outlines of the various departments, a few suggestions and directions relating directly to the work of physical training that have interested us.

Dr. Scott, physiological psychology, successfully carried out a preliminary child-study experiment with twenty-two pupils of the Fifth Grade, the conditions for which happily insured some very interesting results. (We hope these and other results will shortly be compiled.) This grade of children was especially selected for the practice and study of games and plays, the discussion of work proposed, at present engaging a special committee. An extremely. interesting syllabus for discussion by teachers was also prepared in this connection by Dr. Scott on children’s interests. Dr. Scott insists that the greatest need in carrying out a rational education is an extension of our knowledge of nascent, periods. It is impossible to obtain the normal age of

development of these periods without a wide examination, involving many thousands of children. It is only by comparison with the general and normal that blundering is prevented and definite progress is assured.

Dr. Derexa Morey-Errant, at the request of a large number of persons making a practical application of the results of child-study, discourses on the care of children, their growth, development, adolescence, etc. These lectures and discussions are intended to be of direct assistance to parents and teachers—the child-study section, presided over by Mrs. Jackman, being the direct outcome of the regular parents’ meetings conducted at this school.

The department of physical training last summer collected a vast amount of statistical material, relating to the growth and development of children. This material in the main was furnished by the Normal School of Gymnastics of the N. A. G. U. and included statistics of several cities and charts of a number of well-known institutions, also Dr. Sargent’s valuable charts. The material, carefully arranged, was placed in the library of the school for the use of the assistant teachers of gymnastics and regular teachers of the practice school. The tabulations embraced from 8—50 items and illustrated the relation of the individual physical development to the normal standard of the same age. They represented the results of a large number of measurements and tests of males as well as females of all ages from 6—30 years. It is suggested in the respective outline that the teachers of the different rooms representing the ages enumerated, design a form of records to be taken in September and May and optionally in January, the items for which, including the figures given for the different ages, for comparison, are to be selected or computed from these tabulations. Strength and other tests in addition, especially designated by the head of department, were to be recorded. Also special tests at the option of the respective teachers. The different records are to be kept by the pupils, the results of their measurements and tests to be entered and traced by them before the close of September and again in May. Record-slips are to be furnished pupils in the form of a printed card of convenient size which they can take home. Entries are also to be transferred to the large charts furnished each room, the measurement and test averages of the different ages and classes to be established before the close of the year.

The interest in this work and the resultant work of the different rooms, now completed, has offered incentives in other directions. Morning exercises, in the chapel, for instance, were devoted to illustrations of charts and tracings on the black-boards, the children relating their experiences in the work entailed.

Number work of the practice department also closely followed the work of physical training during the month. The following exercises illustrate work suggested :

NATIVE ALASKA LIFE.

SIMON KICIK, a Yukon Indian in the employ of an Alaskan transportation and mining company, has been the inofficial representative of his people in Chicago a short time ago. Simon is 21 years of age, short but muscular of stature, and dark of skin. He has a face which beams with good nature and alertness. Although he is sometimes obliged to hesitate for a word, his English is pure and correct to a remarkable degree. In speaking of the games and plays of children as pastimes, he said :

“The children of Alaska have a good time every day, but they are happiest in the autumn when the leaves fall from the trees and scatter over the beach. Then it was that we used to make big camp and play that we were great hunters like our fathers, only much greater. Each boy had a little girl to do the work for him, and when we returned from our hunt we would bring many big leaves with us. These were the skins of foxes, bears, deer, and sea otter. Our women, as we called the little girls, would take the leaves and sew them together into bright colored blankets, as they had seen their mothers do with the skins our fathers brought. With clay the girls built little pots and kettles and if we did not find a small piece of dried fish inside we made a big fuss.

“Sometimes one boy would try to get another boy’s mate away from him—all in play, of course—and then there would be a big fight. And often they were hard battles, too, for a little Alaskan boy can fight like a mean sledge dog. Another game which we played was carrying the sacks of seal oil. All the boys but the carrier would lie down in a row like sacks. The carrier would pass along the row and draw his hand across each ankle repeating: ‘With what shall I walk?’ Then he would come and pretend to cut off the hands in the same way saying: ‘With what shall I eat?’ Not a boy would stir after that, but remain as stiff and still as a log. They couldn’t—for they were bags of seal oil which had been brought from the coast in exchange for skins !

“The carrier then had to do the hardest work of all—put the sacks upon his shoulder, carry them quite a distance, and stake them up like the real bags. When the last one was placed on the pile there w^as a shout and a cry, and every boy was on his feet in an instant. Other games were tag and blindfold. But in the long winter nights, wffien the fire in the center of the cabin was bright and the flames leaped almost to the smoke-hole in the top, we children would sit and listen to the stories which our fathers told of how the world was made by the old crow, of their fights with bears and wolves, of the great storms, and of the many deer that they had killed. These were all very interesting. Each boy learned to build sleds and to make traps for fish, the squirrels, and other animals. In the winter, too, we had the big feasts when the people of other villages came to visit us. WThat fun it was for the children to see the great mask dance wffiich lasted one night only. But there were three other nights of dancing during the whole feast. Probably that which made the feast days so much enjoyed by us was the fact that there was plenty of fat grouse and venison, for the children as well as the grown folks.”

CORRECT SITTINC AS AN EXERCISE.

NOTING the presence of weak and rounded backs, consequent upon faulty sitting postures, one is easily convinced that the evolution of correct sitting is far from complete. Much needs to be done in teaching and training children and youth to assume correct sitting and standing attitudes, before good form in the human body is a common characterislic of civilized people.

The results attained by training the muscles of the back to hold the body comfortably erect have convinced the writer that the education of the individual to sit properly is an important method of procedure in at least two respects : first, in treating the fatigue following effort, the common symptom of so many cases of weak back and general invalidism ; and second, that by continual practice of this exercise the trunk can be held straight and in good form for long periods without becoming tired, much the same as the head is poised and held erect without resting throughout the day. Soldiers, coachmen, and persons of a calling in which correct body attitudes are a necessity, stand and sit with perfect ease during their waking hours.

A faulty sitting posture generally results from a failure to keep the waist line straight, or more properly, viewed from the back, slightly curved forward. The bending or sagging of this line backwards drops the elevated position of the chest, and tends to crowd together the internal organs. In sitting properly, the chest remains elevated and the bending of the body occurs near the hips.

Whether the sitting posture is partially or fully relaxed, the aim should be to bend, incline, or support the body in such a manner as will still preserve a correct waist line, and free action of the chest. A large, well-developed chest will assert itself, not only by reason of its size and formation, but because it demands full and free action. Hence it will be observed that as a rule the athlete will assume more graceful and more correct attitudes of resting, even in extreme lounging, than the narrow-chested individual. The former is not comfortable unless his lungs have fair play.

Leaning forward with a bent back and drooping shoulders is not a truly relaxed or restful position, because the lungs and internal organs are cramped. Likewise, reclining backward or sliding down in the seat until the tip of the spine and the shoulders are the two points of support, is as ungraceful as it is incorrect. The spinal column sags or bends backward with the same contracting effect on the breathing and abdominal organs, the upper viscera pressing down upon the lower. Furthermore the anatomical arrangement and attachment of the muscles of the abdomen is such that the sagging backward of the vertebral column relaxes these muscles, thus allowing the abdominal organs, already crowded from above, to bulge forward, forming a noticeable

Digitized by CjOOQle
-208-

protrusion of the anterior surface of the body contour. The abdominal muscles, therefore, are over-relaxed by this pressure from within, and gradually becoming attenuated are less able to preserve a normally tense abdominal wall. Much of the general weakness and indisposition of men and women of the leisure class can be directly traced to imperfectly developed muscles of the back and waist. Lack of body activity and the easy-chair habit are the two most evident contributing causes for this condition.

It is not to be expected that the individual with a weak or deformed back, or rounded shoulders, or the invalid in general, will be able at first to sit properly for any length of time. The act of sitting erect, like all attempts to improve the form and strength of the body, is to be treated as an exercise to be practiced for short periods, gradually increasing the frequency and duration of each effort.

The practical result of viewing the act of sitting erect as a special exercise, and devoting considerable attention to it, is that the subsequent active efforts of the invalid are attended with less fatigue and the progressive gain in strength is more rapid. The patient who remains in bed longer, and limits the body energy to training first the back muscles, will gain time over the patient who expends the same energy in more general and indiscriminate exercise.

It is true that the local back training goes hand in hand with more general exercising; one helps and supplements the other, but the great value of correct sitting as an exercise, is that it can be undertaken early and practiced daily before other active body movements are advisable. In many forms of nervous weakness and convalescence from sickness in bed it is especially valuable, as the heart’s action is least accelerated, and the entire body remains passive with the exception of the back muscles which are under quiet but steady tension.

SUGGESTIONS.

In partially or fully relaxed sitting attitudes, endeavor to adjust the body in such a manner as will insure as straight a waist line as possible and free play for the lungs and internal organs. In the ordinary chair sit firmly into the angle formed by the back and seat, and keep the chest and shoulders well up. A firm rather than yielding back-sofa is admissible at the beginning of convalescence, but is not to be recommended for any extended practice, on account of the tendency of acquiring a rounded spine. An inverted chair with short, straight back, or a wide board cushioned with a single pillow, is a preferable support, as the trunk of the body can then be held in fairly good line from the hips up.

Study to sit gracefully, whether upright or in the relaxed position. Stiffness and rigidity denote a failure to relax muscle groups which should be at rest. The cultivation of a graceful posture is essential to ease and comfort and the ability to sit correctly a long time.

The proper mental attitude to be assumed in this, as in all exercises, is of supreme importance. Especially is this true in the case of invalids. The individual must thoroughly appreciate the value of strong back muscles, and be willing to work slowly but persistently to acquire them.

VERTICAL WRITING AND ITS INFLUENCE UPON BODILY ATTITUDE.

THE School Board of Milwaukee has under consideration the question as to whether it should adhere to the present style of penmanship or adopt the new vertical system of writing for its public schools. Of late many eminent scientists and educators from different countries have opened war against the inherited slant writing. They maintain that it means a waste both of time and space, and that furthermore it is injurious to the eyes particularly and to the health of the pupils in general. The vertical style has been termed, and justly deserves to loe called, the ‘‘natural” style. Conclusive proof has been brought forward that writing originally was done in a vertical manner, and that only in comparatively recent times a habit has been developed whereby the letters were written in a forward inclining direction.

While this change may not have been of any importance at a period when very few persons mastered the art of writing, yet in the course of time, especially since children were forced to spend a number of years behind the school desks, it has become a fruitful source of deteriorating influences upon their health during school life. The ophthalmologist advanced the main arguments in favor of the vertical penmanship. He claims that it is the eyes that suffer most through the faulty bodily attitude in the slanting system ; that it forces them out of the natural horizontal plane and places them at an unequal distance from the visual object. But the orthopedic surgeon has just as much cause to find fault with the slanting method of writing as has the ophthalmologist. Innumerable instances of curvature of the spine have been traced back to the faulty posture assumed in slant writing. It is a fact well known to every school teacher that in writing sloping script, children unconsciously tilt their heads to the side and push paper or slate somewhat obliquely towards the left. This attitude seems to be the easiest and most comfortable for them, for almost all assume it in the same manner. The consequence is that one hip is more to the front than the other ; so is one shoulder more forward than the other, while the one ear is slightly lower and somewhat behind the other. Simultaneously the trunk in its lower portion inclines to the right, in the upper half to the left ; so the spinal column is gradually being curved and twisted on its long axis. The bones of children are soft ; the muscles (especially in girls wearing corsets) but poorly developed and the ligaments extremely elastic. Such a position assumed for hours day after day affords conditions that are favorable to the production of a spinal curvature, and in fact spinal

curvatures are enormously on the increase, not a few being brought about through the attitude assumed in slant writing.

All that is necessary for their development is a little start; the curve will take care of its own progress. In vertical penmanship the most natural position for the body is an upright one. The paper or slate lying directly in front of the pupil, no spinal curvature is induced, no strain forced upon the normal eye, no cramping of the chest favored. Most of the larger cities of our country and quite a number of the foreign countries have adopted the new penmanship and the authorities are more than only pleased with the results. It is to be hoped that the School Board of Milwaukee give this step in the direction of progress mature deliberation and then enact its practical introduction with determination and a steady purpose.

EXERCISE FOR PRISONERS.

MASSACHUSETTS is noted the world over for the liberality with which she treats her prisoners. Every year new ideas are introduced in the moral training of those kept under lock and key for public good. But the physical welfare of the prisoners also receives constant attention. Recently, at the house of correction in South Boston, a most important step was taken for preserving the health of the inmates. This was the introduction into the prison ri*Je of a system of calisthenics, which was formulated by Koehler, and which was lately made a part of the daily duties of the soldiers in the army of the United States. The introduction of this system was caused by the commissioner of penal institutions, Mr. Marshall. He recognized that the moral reclamation of a prisoner was vastly easier when the latter had a healthy body.

A few weeks ago the system was tried for the first time. Evidently the scheme was pleasing to the prisoners, for every man appeared with a smiling face. Most of them had not the slightest idea of what was expected, and they felt, as they looked, decidedly awkward. Here and there in the ranks, however, was seen one who, from his upright carriage and the ease with which he made the movements, showed that he had served in the army at some time in his checkered career.

There were some old men, too, in marked contrast to their younger companions, with whom rounded shoulders and ill-formed bodies made it impossible for them to fully follow the movements of the corporal. Some of the elderly men found it impossible to raise their arms straight over their heads ; and they found bending the body the hardest kind of work. These men will limber wonderfully in a week or two.

Most of the prisoners seemed to appreciate what was being done for their benefit, and did their best to learn the movements, in many cases with surprisingly good results.

The Koehler system is practically the same as that in vogue in gymnasia and colleges. It includes arm and leg movements, separately and together, bending the body right and left, forward and back from the hip, and a variety of movements, while sitting and lying down.— Boston Herald.

CORRESPONDENCE.

Chicago Instructors.—Is it not possible for you to provide for a report on such matters as the recent Douglas Park Gymnastic Exhibit ? Through an outside p$rty we were informed that the exhibition was noteworthy and that he, therefore, had expected to see at least a program in print.

K.—Your idea that our St. Louis Executive Board should have Turner-songs like “Frisch, Frei, Stark, Treu” and others translated and published in English is a very good one. Good translations could be secured by offering awards.

Maude Myrtle Morgan, Boise, Idaho.—Your letter will be answered by our business department. We shall be pleased to receive your contributions.

H. L., O.—See our article on Vertical Writing. You may do some good by changing the seat and by vigorous exercise but you will hardly be able to correct a well established curve.

The girls form two files, facing each other at two paces distance. During the first part of the song they walk or hop on place. At the words, “O yes, yes, yes’* they bow or courtesy to one another. With the works, “We dance and . . . ... as it is day,” the first three pairs, joining hands, take galop-steps sideward through the aisle and, disconnecting hands, form at the foot of their files. This is being repeated by all the rest of the pairs in turn. Or, the pairs may hop down and up the aisle and take their places before the next set follows; or, the files may make a counter-march, after all pairs have passed down the aisle or between succeeding pairs. The longer the game the more the exercises should vary.

QUERIES.

(With these “Queries” we desire to meet the wishes of different parties who think that a wholesome discussion

could be started in this way.)

1.	Does cycling shorten stride of step? Should • not walking be practiced equally with cycling? Which mode of movement is of greatest advantage physically ?

2.	How best to meet the disinclination of some of our girls toward physical training during the period of adolescence ?

(Names in connection with questions and answers will be published only when so desired. We earnestly nvite our readers to propose other questions and to take part in the discussion of those published.—Ed.)

NOTES AND REMARKS.

—President Harper proposes to introduce military drill at the University of Chicago. The proposition is being considered by the student councils.

—The Executive Committee of the Wisconsin District of the North American Gymnastic Union is making a decided effort to have playgrounds and outdoor gymnasia in the Milwaukee public parks.

—Through some regrettable mistake the article entitled “Some Remarks on Manual Training” in our last issue was signed “Exch.” The article is an original contribution by Mr. Ira M. Carley of the Chicago Normal School.

—The Wisconsin branch of the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education is at present at work on a program for a public exhibition of games which is to take place some time in December. It is planned to have classes of the different gymnasia of this city for the exhibition of one game at a time.

—Pupils of the Englewood High School are much elated over their new outdoor “gym,” which was recently completed. The new gymnasium will have much to do hereafter with the gymnastic and athletic training of the pupils. Its location is between the High and Champlain School buildings, and the apparatus' consists of rings, trapeze, and ladders.

I* —A field day was held at the Western, a college for young ladies at Oxford, 0., Friday, November 5, which, to judge from reports received, must have been a pronounced success. The program consisted of Battle Ball, Running High Jump, Progressive Tennis, Cricket, and Basket Ball. Miss Barrows, the physical director, deserves credit for the well-devised arrangements.

—The subject of playgrounds and small parks for the most crowded parts of New York City has been so persistently agitated by the press that the Small Park Commission proposes to create four more parks and eleven public playgrounds at a cost of $3,000,000. The pressing need for school playgrounds is apparent from the fact that the children are now often turned out on the sidewalks during recreation hours in the absence of a better place to send them to.

—The Ohio Physical Education Association will hold this year its third annual meeting at Dayton, 0., on November 26 and 27. The program includes a report by Mrs. F. W. Leiter on the work done by those institutions affected by the Ohio Physical Training Law ; also reports by Dr. F. E. Leonard on colleges, Mr. W. E. Day on Y. M. C. A.’s ; papers by Dr. L. K. Baker and Mr. A. Leibold. We hope to be able to give account ot what has been done at that meeting in our next issue.

—Gymnastic instructors in the leading colleges will hold a second meeting at New York during the Christmas holidays and will then elect permanent officers for their new organization and transact other important business. A meeting of college gyjnnastic directors of the

country was held recently at the University of the City of New York to form the Association of American College Gymnastic Directors. The following directors were present : Dr. Seaver, Dr. Anderson, and Mr. Shoch, of Yale ; Dr. Sargent, of Harvard ; Mr. Goldie, of Princeton ; Dr. Linhart, of the University ol Ohio ; Dr. Marvel, of Wesleyan ; Dr. Savage, of Columbia, and Dr. Cann, of the University of the City of New York. Dr. Seaver was elected temporary president, and Dr. Savage temporary secretary. Several committees were also appointed. The object of the association is to promote uniformity in gymnastics and physical training. This includes methods of instruction, anthropometry, and strength tests. By thus unifying the American system it can be brought into favorable competition with other systems. This meeting was the most important of its kind ever held and was called at the request of Dr. Anderson and Dr. Sargent of Harvard.

—A New gymnasium and armory for the Ohio State University at Columbns, 0.* This beautiful building will be finished about the first of May. The drill-hall and gymnasium floor is eighty feet wide by one hundred and fifty feet long. The roof is carried on curved steel arches and lighted from a clear-story at the top. There is a running track around the entire room, about twelve feet from the floor. At the center of the south side is a visitors’ gallery, seating about two hundred persons. At the northwest corner of the floor is a stairway leading down to the men’s locker and dressing room, while the young women go down a similar way at the northeast corner to their rooms. On the level with the main floor, near the main entrance at the south, is a large room for the use of the commandant and his classes, and rooms for the director of the gymnasium. Above the commandant’s room is the room for the officers of the University Cadet Corps. The basement is very high and well lighted. On the young men’s side are dressing and locker rooms, the bath room with shower and plunge baths, a bicycle room, a lecture room, the cannon room, the band room, and a large room which is to be the home of the University Athletic Association. On the young women’s side are the locker rooms and bath rooms—precisely like those provided for the young men ; a bicycle room, lecture room, and private office for the instructor in Sanitation and Hygiene for Young Women. Between the young men’s apartments and those for the young women is a large cafe and lunch room. This has become a necessity because of the large number of students who remain on the campus all day. It will be in the hands of a competent caterer, and will also be the “laboratory” for the work of the cooking classes of the Department of Domestic Science.

CHANGES IN THE TEACHING CORPS OF THE N. A. G. U.

—Mr. Emanuel Haug, a graduate of the Normal School of the N. A.G.U., was the one that came out on top in the examination for the position of instructor of gymnastics of the boys’ high school in New York. Nineteen ladies and six gentlemen, graduates of different schools, had taken the examination.

—Mr. Louis Gerichten, formerly instructor of the St. Louis, then of the San

* It is to be regretted that such a beautiful gymnasium should at the same time be used for military drill. In the first place, we believe that a drill-hall can, in a hygienic sense, never be a desirable gymnasium, and secondly, that the time taken up by the drill could be spent much more profitably in gymnastic work.

TO CLASS LEADERS AND ACTIVE MEMBERS OF SOC’S.

QUESTIONS.

1.	What are the advantages—if any—of the proposed new uniform for the active turners ? (Knickerbockers and short jacket of gray flannel, cream colored long-sleeved shirt, red belt, black stockings and shoes, and gray fedora hat.)

2.	Why should our active turners not use spiked shoes in their field-sport contests ?

Mr. Editor The question “What is the best temperature in the gymnasium during the winter months,” as raised in your April issue, has not been answered. I wish to say that it very much depends upon the outside temperature, upon the climate of the respective place, upon the work to be done, age, sex, etc., etc. Under normal conditions 65° F. should be about right.	A.	K.,	St.	L.

0f the next Centura* James L. Hughes, inspector of schools, 9r Toronto, Canada, spoke on “The Schools of the Twentieth Century” as fallows: “The schools of the twentieth century schools are called free because attendance at them is free. The child will be free in the twentieth century school. Free growth is the only full growth. The coercive, mandatory, compulsory spirit will become but a shameful memory when teachers aim to develop the divinity in the child instead of making their supreme purpose the restriction of its depravity.

“The child will be trained to find most of its problems in the twentieth century school. Problem discovery is more educative than problem solution, and infinitely more useful to the individual and the race. Teachers will not try to dominate the interest of the child in the twentieth century school. The pupil’s self-active interest is the only persistent propelling motive to intellectual effort. The child’s self-active interest is dwarfed by the substitution of the teacher’s interest for its own; interest power is blighted, the tendency of self-activity of interest is weakened. Teachers will learn that fheir duty is to supply proper conditions and environment. The child’s interest acts spontaneously under appropriate conditions.

“Teachers will distinguish clearly between responsive activity and self-activity, between expression and self-expression, in the twentieth century school. Selfactivity includes the motive as well as the activity, the initiative as well as the executive activity. It must be originative as well as operative, or selfhood is not developed. The neglect of selfhood and the warping of selfhood have been the greatest evils of school life in the past.

“The schools of the twentieth century will give increased attention to physical culture to arrest the physical deterioration of the race, and strengthen it intellectually and morally; they will give manual training for educational, not economic reasons, and to all children, especially to younger children, instead of to senior pupils, as at present; they will teach art as the highest form of human expression to qualify for clearer interpretation of the artistic ideals of the leaders in human evolution, and to enlarge the expressive power of the humanity; and their supreme purpose will be to develop a strong, self-reliant, self-directing individuality and train it by the experiences of school life lo become a co-operative element in an interdependent community.

ATHLETICS.

NOTES AND COMMENTS.

—Mr. Rudolph C. Lehmann, the famous English coach, is again training the Harvard crews. He well deserved the enthusiastic reception he received by over 2000 students, as his spirit and ideals of true sportsmanship have been of great benefit, not only to Harvard, but to the rowing world generally.

—A new bicycle brake which fits into the hub of the rear wheel and is controlled by the pedals is now attracting considerable attention.

—S. G. Thompson of Princeton College is the inter-collegiate tennis champion.

—The trustees of the University of Illinois have given up the entire second fioor of Machinery Hall for gymnastic and athletic purposes. It is to be thoroughly fitted out and will fill a much needed want.

—‘ Gas-meters run fast because they are so light-footed.”—L. A. W. Bulletin.

—Harry Beecher, the famous Yale quarter-back, is now a foot-ball writer for several papers.

—Wealthy Yale under-graduates have raised the necessary funds ($5000) for the improvement of the Yale Athletic Field.

—Lives of foot-ball men remind us,

If we’d win through thin and thick All the battles we’ve assigned us We must kick and kick and kick.	—L. A. W. Bulletin.

—“Although a game of foot-ball isn’t exactly a race, it may be won by a few feet.”

—The Young Men’s Christian Association of Hartford, Conn., has a special "boxing teacher.

—Phillipp’s Andover (Mass.) Academy is making a very determined effort to raise $50,000 for a new gymnasium. Best of wishes for their success in the good work.

—The quarter-mile salt water swimming championship of England was won hy Percy Cavill in 4 minutes 50 seconds.

—D. B. Renear, who holds the world’s record for swimming 100 yards, was Beaten in an open race recently at Honolulu by Kimokeo, a native swimmer, in 1 minute 25 seconds. This is the first time that the former has ever been beaten.

WALTER CAMP ON FOOT-BALL.

For the first time in many years the foot-ball season opened under the same set of rules as those under which the sport throve in the previous year.

Mass play, close formation, will as certainly be the rule as it was toward the -end of last season. The various ways by which, say, six men weighing in the aggregate nearly half a ton can be thrown with as much momentum as possible against half as many and weighing five or six hundred pounds, is the present all-absorbing problem of the foot-ball strategist, and some new developments along that line will be hailed with enthusiasm by captain and coach.

One of the teams have already chosen a line of such solidity as to be characterized by the facetious as “the fat man’s brigade,” and everywhere men of less than 200 pounds at the opening of the season are hardly considered at all for the middle of the line. It is difficult to tell where to look for the brilliant manoeuvers that may perhaps help the situation. Pennsylvania and Harvard 4 have done more in the way of elaborate construction of plays in the last three or four years than Yale or Princeton. It may be that we can hope from one of those for some unusual plays that can be operated without the accessory of

great weight. But Harvard seems given over to a heavy line already, and even at Philadelphia it looks dark for anything that can match up skill against weight.________________________________________

HEALTH AND ATHLETICS.

What is precisely meant by the words “athletics” and “healthy”? The former may be dismissed in a word or two. By an “athlete” is meant the “trained” man, he who undergoes special preparation for a certain object. Of course, an untrained man may be an athlete, but the word is generally used in the more special sense. Therefore, under this category will not be included those who “go in for exercise” as distinguished from “athletes.” And now, what is it to be “healthy”? It is easier.to say what it is not, than what it is. A man may be a fleet runner, a fine oar, splendidly muscular, and agile, yet need not be . “healthy” as the writer understands the word. It sounds like a paradox, but n. man may be able to lift tremendous weights, to put on a terrific spurt at the end of a long and punishing race, to “send in his left” with amazing force and rapidity, and yet be absolutely delicate. In short, physical strength and health,

. often as they have been considered as synonymous, have very little to do with one another.

What then do we mean by being “healthy”? Briefly, it may be said that the healthy system is that of which all the parts work in perfect* harmony. Such a system requires a very great shock, indeed, to throw it altogether out of gear. It has great recuperative powers, which tend to make up any deficiency caused by carelessness or disease. The healthy system possesses, moreover, great ' elasticity, and works vigorously to throw off any evil germs before they have got a secure footing. Health is a good deal more than the absence of disease; it is emphatically an active condition. And its distinguishing sign is adaptability. The really healthy man is he who, after catching a slight cold, goes to bed, sleeps soundly, and wakes up perfectly well in the morning; who easily recovers from any unusual strain upon his organization; who can stand extremes of climate, privation, and hardship; who is not permanently upset by even a violent departure from his ordinary course of life ; who does not trouble much about what he eats and drinks, so long as it is wholesome; this is a healthy man. He may or may not be what is rather erroneously termed “strong”; that is a trifling matter. Whether he is strong in another and truer sense of the word may be judged by those who know how often your great, strong athletic fellow succumbs to a complaint which the so-called “weakling” manages to struggle through.

To return to the athlete. Can any one who has any real knowledge of the subject den}' that, judged by the standard which has been laid down, the athlete will, as a rule, be found wanting ? Let us take the oarsman as typical of the amateur athlete. To look at the young ’varsity oar is to get an impression of a man thoroughly hardened to wind and weather, to whom such things as colds and chills were unknown. But is it so ? Most emphatically, no ! How often do we hear of his being temporarily incapacitated through some trifling mishap or indisposition? How often is he laid up? How often “off color”? How often down with something serious ? And especially is this noticeable when he is a little older and has left off training regularly. If one casts one’s memory back through the years, how many once brilliant athletes can we call to mind as having broken down and died untimely deaths ?

We can think of many, but the names of those who have not died, but have just managed to keep alive after struggling through long and painful illnesses, is legion. Allusion is not here made to specific complaints—such as heart disease— brought on by over-exertion, although this is not infrequent. But what is meant is rather the general weakening of the system, the loss of that “spring” and energy which are so essential to a man who has to fight against illness. As with the oarsman, so with the running man. The latter is particularly prone to little injuries to his feet and legs, and in him the results of training are shown very graphically. For an ordinary man the cure of a sprained ankle or strained tendon is a matter of weeks; for the trained man it often means being for months on the shelf. So long as things shape a normal course he appears to be in perfect health; directly the unexpected occurs, one sees that he does not possess the recuperative energy he so badly needs.
