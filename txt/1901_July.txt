DR. FOSTER’S REPORT.

IT has been the custom for years to appoint some of the foremost educators in physical training to act in a committee of observation at the national festivals of the North American Gymnastic Union. Their individual reports serve the Union to benefit by the criticisms, may they be favorable or adverse.

Of the reports thus far published I have read with much interest the one in the last issue of Mind and Body by Dr. Bertha Foster. It is a most noteworthy and interesting expression of a deep and philosophic mind. Though some of the phases of physieal training are most beautifully and originally expounded, there are some passages in the report wherein I disagree, where Dr. Foster agrees with German physical training as she sees it, and vice versa.

The learned writer speaks of German gymnastics as purely educational, not corrective. If by corrective orthopedic gymnastics were meant, the statement were wisely made. But this seems hardly plausible. Educational gvmnastics, however, should have, and the German system has, such qualities as are conducive to correct the ailings of the race in any climate and land. These shortcomings may be considered from an educational point of view to be of normal character—racial. The

great mistake of other systems has been to lay stress principally on some shortcoming of man, physical or mental, overlooking that which is sound and whole. The German system is based on that which is healthy, trusting by its resources to besides overcome and correct the defects. There is the difference in a nut-shell.

We certainly all agree that memorized exercises for children should not be the rule in the gymnasium. But, the writer is not correct in her criticism of the evening’s performance in the Music Hall. These numbers on the program were rather the outcome of months and even years of faithful training. It needed but some few lessons to arrange the learned material to a fine composition. We might just as well condemn learning poetry by heart, which we justly may, if the preparation in language and thought were inadequate to the age of Vhe pupils. The magnitude and variety of the German system rather precludes this criticism though it may apply to some other system. If mistakes are made it is rather the teacher’s than the fault of German physical training.

“These events (the competitive work of the classes) are selected after the Y. M. C. A. Pentathlon theory, etc.’’ Dr. Foster is mistaken. The competitive exercises of the Union include wholly different types of activity and so make it impossible for a man to earn his prize by neglecting one part of his body and overtraining another, and this policy was adopted prior to any physical work done by the Y. M. C. A.

Dr. Foster compares the wand exercises with the Robert Dumb-Bell Drill. The impression may thus be conveyed as though the German societies were practicing some set drill in their gymnasia. This is, however, not the case. Any good teacher can compose, on the spur of the moment, more valuable material than all Robert’s drill contains. He must, indeed, be a very resourceless teacher who needs anybody’s drill in teaching classes. It is doubtful whether Mr. Pertuch’s excellent wand drill has ever been repeated in any gymnasium since the festival.

In making this criticism of a criticism I fully acknowledge Dr. Foster’s fine perception of the ethical side of German physical training. Her rendering of the evolutionary thought is magnificent, and Campanella’s saying that “The laws of nature proclaim themselves and are their own avengers,” finds eloquent expression. I congratulate the Union in selecting Dr. Foster a member of the committee.—Hans Ballin.

Marching in the Armies. Very interesting is the comparison of the number of steps per minute during marching in the different nations. The German army requires 114 steps in ordinary marching, 120 in quick step, and 175 in double quick or running. In Belgium the steps in common marching number 110, in Austria 118, and in Italy and England 120. In the French army the marching is begun with 120 and is gradually increased to 125—135 (pas accelere). In the return march, however, the 120 pace is maintained throughout. The length of step in the German army is 80 cm. in the quick-step and 100 in running; that of the Austrian, French, Italian, Swiss, Belgian, and Swedish army, 75 cm.; the Russian 71 cm. The running step of the French measures 86 cm.

HOW TO BREATHE.

Most people, when they breathe properly, do it rather by instinct than consciously; and, on the other hand, hundreds of thousands of people do not breathe well, and are suffering from more or less severe affections of the lungs or throat, on account of this manner of incomplete respiration, or, in other words, because they breathe too much by the mouth and not enough through the nostrils. The mouth has its own proper functions, eating, drinking, and speaking; and the nostril* have theirs, smelling and breathing. It is obviously less dangerous to breathe by the mouth in summer than in winter. If you inspire through the natural tube, the nostril, the air passing over the mucous membrane lining the different chambers of the nose is warmed to the temperature of the body before entering the lungs. On the contrary, if you breathe by the mouth, the cold air comes into contact with the delicate membrane which lines the throat and lungs and gives rise to local chilling, which often culminates in inflammation. Many people in winter use respirators, which they place over the mouth on going out of doors; thus diminishing the quantity of air which passes between the lips, and compelling them to breathe through the nostrils. But they may achieve the same result by keeping the lips closed, a habit which is easily acquired and induces a natural method of breathing. We believe that if we all adopted the simple rule of shutting the mouth while breathing, there would be a noticeable diminution in lung and throat affections, which have many victims during the year. Man is the only animal who adopted the pernicious and often fatal habit of breathing by the mouth. The habit is contracted in infancy, and is strengthened in adults, thus causing consumption, bronchitis, sore throat, etc.

In conclusion, we'would simply ask our readers to try the experiment. When they go out in the cold morning air, let them try the two methods of breathing, by the mouth and through the nose. In the first case, if they breathe between the open lips, the cold air rushing into the lungs creates a sensation of cold and uneasiness, often provoking a cough; but in the second they will observe that respiration is free and agreeable, for the fresh air is warmed to the temperature of the body by passing over the nasal mucous membrane and is sweet and soothing to the lungs.—From The Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette.

—During the last month of June and first days in July the Bohemian Gymnastic Federation Sokol held its festival in the city of Prague, which surpassed everything of this kind ever seen in that ancient city. The gymnastic unions of France, Poland, Servia, Russia, and Belgium have sent strong delegations to this fest and each nationality appeared in its special exercises and games. Special features of the fest were mass exercises of Sokols in which 6000 stalwart gymnasts took part, then wand exercises of Juniors (boys between 14 and 18 years) numbering over 700 — and beautiful club-swinging by 900 ladies. French gymnasts exhibited unusual agility and strength on apparatuses. The last number of the long program was an exhibition of “a riding squad of Sokols,”

in which the Bohemians showed their visitors many daring feats in fancy horsemanship. 13,000 gymnasts took part in the parade.—The Bohemian Gymnastic Federation Sokol contains 571 societies with 47,428 members.

TO BUFFALO AWHEEL.

The Press Department of the Pan-American Exposition has issued a booklet entitled “The Pan-American Exposition and Outdoor Recreation” for the benefit of those who are interested in outdoor sports and more particularly for the benefit of wheelmen and automobilists who desire to tour to Buffalo.

This book is neat in appearance, handsomely illustrated and contains much information which is of the greatest value to tourists; including maps of the City of Buffalo and the Exposition Grounds; a road map of Erie and Niagara counties showing delightful side trips to Niagara Falls and other points of interest on the Niagara Frontier, besides detailed descriptions of the following “trunk line” bicycle and automobile routes leading to Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and the Pan American Exposition from all points within a radius of 500 miles.

1—	From Kingston, Ont., via Toronto and Hamilton (tourists from Ottawa, Montreal, and the Thousands Islands connect with this route at Kingston).

2—	From Boston and New England points (connecting with Route 3 at Shodack Centre, N. Y., near Albany).

3—	From New York and Albany via the Hudson River, the vallev^ of the Mohawk and the cycle paths of Central and Western New York.

4—	From New York via Delaware Water Gap, Scranton, Bing-hampton. Elmira and the cycle paths of the Southern tier of counties.

5—	From Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia (connecting with Route 4 at the Delaware Water Gap).

6—	From Pittsburg via Erie, Pa., (connecting with Route 9 at Girard, Pa.).

7—	From Cincinnati (connecting with Route 9 at Cleveland).

8—	From Indianapolis (connecting with Route 7 at Columbus, O.).

9—	From Chicago via Cleveland and Erie, Pa. (the road from Erie to Buffalo along the south shore of Lake Erie has been called the finest 100-mile straight away in America).

10—	From Milwaukee by steamboat across Lake Michigan to Grand Haven, thence via Detroit, Windsor, Ont., through Canada to Hamilton, connecting there with Route 1.

In addition to the cycling features, a description is given of the magnificent Stadium and the various sporting events which have been arranged, including the two weeks of bicycling racing, which will take place from August 5th to 17th, and also a general description of the Exposition grounds.

Copies of this valuable book can be obtained by writing to the Press Department, Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, N. Y.

HOW TO SUCCEED IN TRACK ATHLETICS.

IN track athletics as in wealth, there is no royal road to success. It is time and perseverance that makes the man. Many a good man has gone astray simply because he became discouraged so easily, or because he allowed a few defeats to dishearten him. The rule in athletics is no different from the rule of the ordinary affairs of life. Success comes from hard work, associated with good judgment. As an illustration of this fact a story is told of one of Yale’s track men, who was during his freshmen year a candidate for the track team in the quarter-mile event. At the end of the year he found himself defeated by almost all his fellow contestants, while the second year brought forth results that were not much more promising. At the end of his junior term he had greatly improved his form and judgment in running, but still he had not attained his coveted position. His last chance came at the dual games between Yale and Harvard, when he was a senior. His faithful work had so improved him, that he was the first man to cross the tape in his race. And never was there a man more deserving of a “Y”. The coachss all pronounced him a success. There are but few great track athletics in the world to-day. We conclude from the study of the history of these men that their success is not due to natural ability so much as to constant application and hard training. Kraenzlein, the greatest of the world’s athletes, was not the product of one or two years work. He acquired a degree of perfection in athletics by a gradual development. However, we are not all so fortunate as to be under the control of a sensible, skilful trainer. But whether a man trains alone or at the direction of another he must study himself and profit by his observation. An athlete has need of all the knowledge he may possible acquire and it is therefore well to seek the advice of those experienced in athletics.

If one is working in the distance runs he must be prepared to work harder and longer than he who is practicing for the dashes. Most trainers agree that it takes a distance man seven weeks to round into form, while a sprinter will make a relative improvement in from three to four weeks. In order to be better prepared for their hard daily work, distance runners should have a sufficient amount of sleep. Vitality should be stored up for use in competition. It is the man who has been careful with his body, who can stand the greatest strain. For this reason the rules of health should be observed the whole year round. When the time for the race comes, no matter what the distance, it should be entered with confidence in what we can do. There is no danger of bodily harm if the training has been systematic. Injury in athletics is the result of improper training, the body not being in condition to stand the tension or strain placed upon it.

Unless you are saving yourself for some second or following event, be prepared to expend all your strength in the race you are running. Be prepared for surprises. If you feel that you will not be capable of a strong finish, get out and run your race from the start; this may be tiresome to you but nevertheless you have the satisfaction of knowing the other fellow has probably the same feeling. Do not wait for pace;

if the race does not suit your style of running rely upon your own efforts. Many a good man has lost his event by hanging back and reserving his strength for the finish. It is alwaj’s advisable to know something of your competitor’s style of running, before the pistol is fired. Then go into the race prepared to win and take no chance of losing.

Especially in the sprints fight every foot of the distance. It is important here to get off the mark fast and to get into the regular stride as soon as possible. Do not undervalue the first few yards of the distance and rely entirely on your strong sprint; the other fellow may show just as great a burst of speed. And so in the field events, be just as sure of the beginning of the contest as you are of the end. Be methodical and certain. Never fail to pay attention to form. Hard work and constant practice bring out the “stars.” Perfect health is necessary to success.—Otto Bismarck Frank, Ann Arbor, Mich.

THE L. A. W. MEET.

The 22d annual meet of the League of American Wheelmen, which will be held in Buffalo during the week beginning August 12th, is attracting more widespread attention than has been given to any previous meet held within the last decade. The enthusiasm of the old members of the League is making itself felt in all section^ of the country and many new names are being added to swell the list of loyal wheelmen who have pulled together for so many years in the interest of better roads and the rights and privileges of wheelmen on the highways and railways of the country. Those wheelmen are coming to Buffalo by the thousands and the people of the city as well as the local wheelmen are at work planning for their comfort and accommodation.

Cyclists who do not find it convenient or desirable to tour to Buffalo should not fail to bring their wheels with them, as from any section of the citv the Pan-American Exposition can easily be reached over smooth asphalt pavements or parkway cycle paths, while the magnificent scenery, and many points of historic interest along the Niagara Frontier can be easily reached and fully enjoyed by the wheelmen.

The local wheelmen are well organized and several efficient committees have been appointed to make arrangements and plan entertainment for the visiting wheelmen.

In addition to these committees, they have opened an L. A. W. Hotel and Information Bureau whose business it is to answer any inquiries in regard to hotel accommodations or such other details as may be necessary for the convenience of the visiting wheelmen. The chairman of this bureau is W. J. J. Kunzie, 380 William Street, Buffalo, N. Y.

About 10,000 householders have opened their homes for the reception of guests. Many new hotels have been built, and apartment houses have been reconstructed for hotel purposes. It is estimated that, without crowding, from 150,000 to 200,000 people may be accommodated within a convenient distance of the Exposition grounds. Leaving off the expense of railroad fare which varies with the distance to be traveled, the expenses in Buffalo for one person may be estimated as follows:

-107-

Lodging...........................  $	.50

Three meals.............................75

Admission to Exposition.................50

Incidentals.............................25

Total for one day and night..... $2.00

These figures are neither high nor low and may be considered as conservative and reliable. Of course a great deal more money may be spent, but it is not necessary, in order to enjoy the Exposition and have a healthful and beneficial outing.—W. Sheldon Bull.

Muscular Exercise and the Creation of Will-Power. Payot recently asserted that muscular activity and will-power are in close relation. As a matter of fact we see the will manifesting itself in the infant by means of muscular movements: The tedious labor, by which every one of us strives to become master of his movements, fastens our willpower and controls our attention. Bodily exercise, therefore, in itself is the elementary school for the will. Lagrange says: Every one knows that the will only becomes a function through muscular activity; everybody has had an opportunity to observe that a muscular exertion is never perfect if not preceded by an exertion of the will. There are instances during the course of an exercise, where the will apparently plays even a greater part than the muscles. The will-power will prove the greater, the oftener it is put into operation. Gymnastics will be more efficient with an increased impulse to accomplish this exertion. The competitive zeal certainly stimulates the will most of all, and games, therefore, are from a moral point of view exceedingiy valuable. Games, then, are a splendid, energetic remedy against two of the most prevalent ailings of our time, namely the extreme incorrigibility and lack of willpower.

CROQUET OR ROQUE.

The ancient game of croquet, sometimes called “Presbyterian Billiards,’' has of late years undergone a change. Instead of the old, long-handled mallets, short-handled ones are used ; instead of wooden balls composition balls like those of the pool game are used, and the big, wide wickets have been replaced by those through which the ball barely squeezes through. The borders of the grounds have been banked and even the name has been changed from croquet to “roque.” It admits of fine skill, and annual tourneys are held.

WE have a number of times observed that publications, that ordinarily subserve the purpose of keeping womanhood informed on prevailing styles in clothing, and simultaneously employ some self-stiled “specialist” in physical culture apparently to review them in regard to the physical requirements of their readers, advocate that the weight of a woman’s dress should be suspended from the shoulders instead of from the hips. We have seen such statements in magazines as well as heard them from the lips of instructors of physical training.

If we consider the anatomy of the human body and bear in mind that the pelvis has to carry all the weight above it, just as the first story of a building sustains the entire weight of the superstructure, we fail to see how the pelvis could be relieved from the burden of the clothing suspended from the shoulders. Not only will the pelvis have to carry the same weight one way or the other, but the spine which in the female, on account of the corset habit, school-desk-influence, etc., loses more and more of the muscular support as generations with similar environments pass by, will all the more show a tendency to assume abnormal curvatures.

The correct place of support for the clothes and garments for the abdomen and extremities is on the pelvis or hip-bones; a stiff yoke-like arrangement will leave the abdomen free of compression.

—We are in receipt of the following postal card which needs no further comment:

483 Beacon St., Boston, Mass., June 29, 1901. To the Members of the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education : Owing to the pressure of other duties and to the failure of the New York Convention either to adopt the Proposed Constitution, or to assure in any way what I believe to be an adequate future for the American Physical Education Review, I felt that I owed it to myself to resign from the .editorship on April 20th, at the aforesaid meeting.

Tiie delay in the publication of the June number is therefore due to the fact that the new Council in New York has not as yet provided my successor. I understand, however, that they are making every effort to do this and trust that they will be successful in the near future.

Very truly yours,	G.	W.	Fitz.

CHARLES DICKENS ON FATIGUE.

Dickens noticed the difference between school work done by fatigued children and that done when they are fresh. He gives the following notice of what occurred when he was himself a schoolboy:

“When I was at school, one of seventy boys, I wonder by what secret understanding our attention began to wander when we had pored over our books for some hours. I wonder by what ingenuity we brought on that confused state of mind when sense became nonsense, when figures wouldn’t work, when dead languages wouldn’t construe, when live languages wouldn’t be spoken, when memory wouldn’t come, when dullness and vacancy wouldn’t go. I cannot remember that we ever conspired to be sleepy after dinner, or that we ever particularly wanted to be stupid, and to have flushed faces and hot, beating heads, or to find blank hopelessness and obscurity this afternoon in what would become perfectly clear and bright in the freshness of to-morrow morning. We suffered for these things, and they made us miserable enough. Neither do I remember that we ever bound ourselves, by any secret oatb or other solemn obligation, to find the seats getting too hard to be sat upon after a certain time; or to have intolerable twitches in our legs, rendering us aggressive and malicious with those members; or to be troubled with a similar uneasiness in our elbows, attended with fistic consequences to our neighbors; or to carry two

Eounds of lead in the chest, four pounds in the head, and several active blue-ottles in each ear. Yet, for certain, we suffered under these distresses and were always charged at for laboring under them, as if we had brought them on of our own deliberate act and deed.”—From “The School Weekly.”

CYCLING NOT WANING.

“The Pan-American Exposition will do much to disprove the idea prevailing in a certain portion of the public mind, that cycling is on the wane. Nothing could be farther from the truth,” recently said Mr. Frank A. Elwell, of Portland, Maine, whose opinions anent cycling cannot fail to be of interest to all wheelmen. Mr. Elwell is a veteran bicycle tourist of wide and varied experience, having conducted many parties through this country and Europe. He is also the author of that useful book “Cycling in Europe,” which is published by the League of American Wheelmen.

When requested to give his views more fully on the subject he said, “Cycling has safely passed through the period of being a fad with the fashionable world and is now in the hands of those who appreciate the wheel at its true worth. These aie the people who use the bicycle as a rapid and economical method of getting from place to place and the class, who have found that its highest enjoyment consists in making extended tours amid new scenes on the highways and byways. A vacation spent in this manner is productive of health and pleasure in measure unsurpassed by any other form of recreation. Never before has the bicycle been so carefully adapted to the means of the tourist wheelmen as it is this year. The raised steering head, coaster brakes and cushion frames are a most grateful change from the dropped bars, hard saddles, high gears, and narrow tires of the last six years, during which everything was sacrificed to lightness and speed. Such wheels are still built and have their admirers, but the hearty approval shown the bicycle built for comfort, speaks eloquently of the desire of the great mass of riders for a wheel on which they may roam far afield with ease and pleasure.

It is safe to say that never before in the history of cycling have there been so many devotees laying plans for extended tours as this year, and with hardly an exception their minds are fixed on Buffalo as the objective point of their travels. There is nothing strange about this. The banks of the Hudson, the plains of

-117-

central New York, dotted with beautiful lakes connected by a net work of cycle paths, afford opportunities for a tour awheel unsurpassed in this country. But, above all, the attractions offered by the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo and the Palls of Niagara will prove irresistible to the cycling tourists, and will be the Mecca towards which they will gravitate by hundreds and thousands. All summer and autumn the asphalted streets of the Queen City of the Lakes will teem with riders of the silent steed, and the enthusiam engendered by such a meeting and mingling of wheelmen from all parts of the Union will prove most beneficial to the cause of cycling in every way. It will awake that fraternal feeling so strong among cyclists twenty years ago, but which of late years, for many reasons, has not been much in evidence. It will give the sidepath movement a boom that will extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and in connection with the automobile, will increase the interest in good roads. The meet of the L. A. W., and the weeks of cycle racing at the Pan-American Exposition, events eagerly anticipated by thousands, will give convincing evidence of the hold the bicycle has obtained in the hearts of the wheelmen of America.’'

“As to how to tour,” continued Mr. Elwell, “that all depends. If you are like the veteran ‘Karl Kron,’ you will decide that one constitutes the ideal number for a cycle tour; if you have the spirit of a Burley B. Ayres, a Lon Peck, or a Henry E. Ducker—other standard authorities—you will believe that a iolly crowd of 100 is about the right size for a good time. Between these two there are as many opinions as there are numbers. However, if you have decided that the ideal tour is to ride when you feel like it and to loaf when you do not, to hurry by unattractive spots, and to linger in the pleasant places and to wait for the spirit to move you, by all means go alone. A party of more than one with this theory would not hang together three days. It sounds well but it doesn’t work. If yOur party consists of more than one, let your plans be mapped out as fully' as possible, and be sure they are thoroughly understood and agreed to by all the members. Let some one be the directing mind, and uphold him in all things that are reasonable. You may not be able to carry out these plans to the letter but they will furnish a standard that will prove invaluable as a base of operations, and with good weather and no accidents there is no reason why they should not be adhered to from start to finish. There is a certain feeling of satisfaction in accomplishing what one has undertaken, that will more than offset any trifling inconvenience at some part of the trip, and the companionship of a pleasant party is well worth the concessions made in the interests of all. A company imbued with this spirit may be large or small, and may look forward with confidence to a most delightful outing.

“If your stay in Buffalo is to be one of some length, you would undoubtedly find it pleasant to have a trunk filled with ordinary clothing awaiting your arrival. In these you can ‘do’ the city and the Exposition like the regular tourist. But if you desire neither the bother nor expense of this arrangement, you will find plenty to keep you company.

“In any case, if you can spare the time, go to Buffalo on, or with, your wheel; it will mark an epoch in your cycling life.”—W. Shelpon Bull.

SHUFFLE-BOARD.

This is an indoor game that is exceedingly popular where it is played but is almost unknown to thousands of persons in large cities and in the average country towns. The most ardent devotees of the game are found in Brooklyn, Paterson, Newark, Philadelphia, and Buffalo, although it is played in a desultory way in some of the western towns. In its crudest forms the game consisted in shoving smooth stones along a board hewed out of a solid tree trunk, but it has been gradually perfected until now the ideal board is 21 feet long and is oiled occasionally and covered with the thinnest possible layer of especially prepared sand. The best players have the manipulation of the weights down to such a fine point that for skill and delicacy of touch it closely resembles either billiards or pool. Once a person becomes thoroughly interested in shuffleboard he is loath to give it up, but for some reason it has never become generally popular with the better classes.

G. Ed. Morris, of Newark, is considered by many the greatest shuffler who

Digitized by ^.ooQte
—118—

^ever shoved a weight, and during the past fifteen years has probably won more big matches than any other exponent of the game' While Morris naturally does most of his playing in Newark, he used to frequently appear in other cities, and was remarkably successful in Philadelphia. Those were a few years ago, when he used to shuffle all the time. In fact, his control of the weights seemed little short of wonderful. One of his favorite tricks was to set two ordinary playing cards up on end at the further end of the board, and then send weight after weight through the small opening without dislodging the cards. Another trick was to stick pins in different parts of the board and then knock them over with the weights. One night nearly a decade ago he played a 21 point game with a •comparative stranger. Morris won with ridiculous ease, but the remarkable part of the affair occured in the very first part of the match, when the famous left-handed player scored 11 out of a possible 12 points, laying three “ships” and a deuce.

Shuffleboards can now be found in a few of the large clubs, but the one great fault, to be tound with the game is the lack of uniformity in the boards and weights. A shuffler can seldom visit a strange city and find the conditions the same as at home; the weights will be either larger or smaller, and the board of different length and faster or slower. If shuffleboards, like billiard tables, were built to uniform size the game would be greatly benefit ted, for experts now do not care to play away from home. The weights in Buffalo are of about the same size, but those of Philadelphia are" big brass affairs, while the sand is poured on the board in such quantities as to require considerable muscular effort, and much of the delicacy of touch, so essential on a faster board, is next to impossible. The fastest boards are the ones which give most satisfaction.— L. A. W. Magazine.

BOOK REVIEW,

-(.All the books mentioned under this head may be ordered from the Freidenker Publ. Co., Milwaukee.)

—Beautiful Swiss and Italian Views. From the earliest times Switzerland has been famed for the majestic grandeur of its mountain scenery, and Italy for the ravishing beauty of its many picturesque lakes. The very names of the Bernina Hospice, St. Moritz, the Jungfrau, Lake Como, Lake Maggiore, the Lake of Lucerne call up entrancing visions of marvelous valleys, peaks and glaciers, frowning mountain-passes, castled shores, and gleaming stretches of glassy water under soft azure skies. To see these enchanting sights even in pictured form is to introduce a broadening influence and a wider outlook into one’s life. In a forthcoming issue of The Ladies’ Home Journal a vivid idea of the Engadin Valley and of some of the Swiss and Italian lakes will be given in a double-page of the most remarkable views ever secured of the more wonderful and lovelier portions of these world-renowned regions.

—The Latest Dress Materials. A very valuable feature of the August Delineator is that which illustrates by photographic process the latest dress materials, accompanying the illustrations with a running comment, so as to guide those who wish to have the fullest knowledge of materials before going shopping. This is one of the features of a practical character that makes The Delineator so highly esteemed by women. The same number also goes very fully into the subject of trimmings and other dainty accessories of dress.

—The Elementary School Teacher and the Course of Study. Edit, by Francis Parker. Vol. II, No. i.—This periodical appeared formerly under the title :	“Course of

Study of the Chicago Institute.” The change of title has become necessary through the amalgamation of the two institutions : “Chicago University’* and “Chicago Institute.” The magazine publishes an outline of the future work in the different branches of the curriculum.

—Physical Training in the School-Room. By Hans Ballin, Supervisor Physical Training, Public Schools, Little Rock, Ark. Price $1.00.—Mr. Ballin evidently employed much time and labor in producing a book of this kind, and he has succeeded well inasmuch as h s work means a decided advance as compared with a good many similar books. It is well illustrated and contains in addition a wall-chart of ail the illustrations found scattered in the text of the book. In the preface, which we print below, Mr. Ballin elucidates the purpose and the tendency of his book in a very satisfactory manner, as follows :

“It is to the inexperienced teacher in gymnastics, to the teacher in rural and city schcols, that this book is offered as a manual for daily lessons. More than a decade of teaching thousands of children in the public schools, and their teachers, has convinced the author that a manual, such as would explain and make quite clear the technology of the subject, and at the same time be of educational value in the school-curriculum when conscienciously carried out, could be made practical. Though the whole of physical training should ultimately embrace more than is offered in this volume, its contents will at all times be the most valuable material for school-gymnastics.

“The lessons for daily use have been carefully prepared for each schoolyear. Four hundred and fifty different exercises are illustrated by one hundred and thirty-two photoengravings, and each position refers directly to an illustration, so that the teacher is never at a loss to know what is desired. The gradual progression should facilitate the teaching, and at the same time be of endless interest to the pupils.

“It is, therefore, with considerable confidence that the author places this volume in the hands of the American teacher. He is at any time most willing to communicate with the teachers personally should anything found in this manual be not quite clear.

“It will be noticed that the words “physical training” are used instead of “physical ■culture.” Though the latter term is more generally understood, it is a misnomer of an educational discipline. There can be no culture unless the ground has been well tilled ; there ■can be no physical eulture, before having trained the physical possibilities of the body. Physical culture should be the result of physical training.”

cap list, useful hints for players, a'glossary of technical terms, and other features will be found in its pages. The Guide will be sent to any address in the United States or Canada upon receipt of ten cents by the American Sports Publishing Co., 16 and 18 Park Place, New York.

—At the Annual Meet of the Knickerbocker Athletic Club /Ray C. Ewry cleared 34 ft. 9V2 in. in three standing broad jumps breaking the world’s record by IY2 inches.

—It has been estimated that over 100,000 spectators witnessed 'the annual contest for the championship cup of the Association Football Teams. The game ended in a tie, Sheffield 2 and Hotspurs 2.

—The announcing at the Intercollegiate Meet this year was a striking feature, there being five such officials, one for the track events, and one for each of the field events that were going on, all with good voices, adding the novel feature of announcing the coming of each competitor and also his performance when the time came. This enabled every spectator to keep a detailed score of the events, like the 16-lb shot-put and the running broad jump that are usually allowed to go on unnoticed. It was pronounced on all sides a feature well worth copying by promoters of athletic sports.
