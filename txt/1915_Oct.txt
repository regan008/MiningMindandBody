NOTES AND COMMENTS

Representatives of Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Pennsylvania and New York University recently formed the Collegiate Anti-Militarism League. Its aim is not only to oppose the introduction of military training in colleges but “to get before men in all the colleges of the country the need of direct and forceful agitation against militaristic tendencies and propaganda” and “what will be the tragic results of furthering the militaristic spirit at this time . . . . whether by half-informed laymen or professional army men.” The president is Karl G. Karsten, Columbia, and the secretary, John Temple Graves, Jr., Princeton.

CAR VENTILATOR WITH A WATER CHAMBER.

A window ventilator for sleeping cars, in which use is made of a water chamber to cleanse the air of dust and soot, has been invented by a Pullman car porter, W. E. McMullin, and has been tried out for the past three months on the trains running between Minneapolis and Aberdeen. It has lately been installed on the pioneer Limited, one of the crack trains of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway.

The device consists of a ventilator which is placed under the sash. At the front end is an opening, 5x8 in., which admits the air from the outside. The air is then forced, by a series of three wheels, through a body of water, so placed in the ventilator that it cannot be spilled either into the car or outside. By the movement of the train the air is whipped through a constant spray of water and

is thus washed and cooled before passing into the berth. A catch basin apartment in the ventilator receives all the dirt and other debris.

In addition to the installations mentioned, further tests are being made on the device by Mr. McMullin, L. J. Bussell and H. E. Bussell, on various sleeping car lines.

The performances of Miss Olga Dorfner, of the Philadelphia Turngemeinde, in the water carnival at Lafayette last Saturday, leave hardly a doubt that this country has at last developed a fair natator second to none in the world at short distance swimming. The international ico-yard record for women stands to the credit of Miss Fannie Durack, of Australia, at 1 minute 6 seconds, and was made under ideal conditions, in a pool which offered the advantage of a good take-off, absolutely still, smooth water and push-offs at the turns. Miss Dorfner did the century in the recent meet in 1 teg 3-5 from a poor dive, over a straightaway ooen water course, with the handicap of no turns and a noticeable current drawing her off the straight line. There is also reason to believe she could have made better time had she been pressed.

Four American swimming records for women were broken on the Schuylkill at Lafayette, Philadelphia, when the girl swimmers from this city and New York competed in the first open A. A. U. championship for women ever held in this country. Olga Dorfner of the Philadelphia Turngemeinde swam the 50 yards distance in 30

2-5 seconds, the 100 yards in 1 :og 3-5, and the 220 yards in 3 115 2-5, all new records, and Lucy Freeman of the National Women’s Life Saving League of New York won the one-mile swim in 35:38, another new record.

Helen Pennypacker of the Philadelphia Turngemeinde was first in the fancy diving contest, with 115.5 points, Josephine Bartlett of New York was second, with 96.5 points, and Emma Passeler of the Philadelphia Turngemeinde was third, with 95.3 points.

The 100 and 220-yard races were the most hotly contested, Miss Claire Galligan, the fastest sprinter in the Metropolitan Association, fighting Miss Dorfner every inch of the way for the lead in the 100-yard event and crossing the tape only five feet behind her in the 220-yard swim.

Robert N. Dowling, an 18-year-old amateur swimmer, performed a feat never before accomplished when he completed the swim around Manhattan Island, a distance of about 35 miles, in 13 hrs. and 45 minutes.

THE PHYSICAL TEST.

An honor man at Trinity College has risked the withholding of his degree because he has not been able to fulfil the freshman and sophomore gymnasium requirements, particularly horizontal bar and horse exercises. A large petition in his behalf, headed by the physical instructor of the gymnasium himself, testifies both to the popularity of the man in question and to college sentiment in regard to the indispensability of the physical test. The mere fact that such a case should arise indicates the importance systematic physical education is taking on in our higher institutions of learning.

In a general way there can be no doubt of the value of such training of the body along with the training of the mind, a practice which has, of course, high and ancient sanction from the days of Athenian supremacy in art and life. But as a requirement for a college degree the physical test, however desirable in most cases, may become an absurdity. Many men capable of brilliant intellectual achievements are for one reason or another debarred from the possibility of physical training. For them proper allowances should be made. An example that pops into mind is the poet Pope. How unjust and ridiculous to withhold from such a man a college degree because of inability to accomplish certain gymnastic feats.

BASEBALL ROUNDS OUT A LIFETIME.

THIS YEAR MARKS SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ADOPTION OF.

FIRST RULES.

It has been suggested that on Sept. 23 of this year the baseball owners commemorate in some way the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the playing rules which form the basis of the present code governing the national pastime. These rules, adopted by the Knickerbocker Association of this city in 1845, are interesting, and to a degree humorous, when compared with the rules governing the contests of today. Probably the only rule existing seventy years ago which has not been amended in some way or totally obliterated by the more commercial managers of the present time is that relating to the number of “outs” required before a team shall take the field. The rule then expressly stated that “three hands out, all out,” and to the present day this rule is in vogue. The rules compiled in 1845: by the Knickerbocker Association follow:

Digitized by 0.ooQLe
705

The bases shall be from “home” to second base, forty-five paces; from first to third base, forty-two paces, equidistant.

The game to consist of twenty-one counts, or aces, (runs;) but at the conclusion an equal number of hands (innings for each side) must be played.

The ball must be pitched, not thrown, for the bat.

A ball knocked out of the field, or outside the range of first or third base, is foul.

Three balls being struck at and missed, and the last one caught, is a hand out; if not caught, it is considered fair, and the striker bound to run.

If a ball be struck or tipped, and caught either flying or on the first bound, it is a hand out.

A player running the bases shall be out if the ball is in the hands of an adversary on the base or if the runner is touched with it before he makes his base; it being understood, however, that in' no instance is a ball to be thrown at him.

A player running, who shall prevent an adversary from catch-ing or getting the ball before making his base, is a hand out.

Three hands out, all out.

Players must take their strikes in regular turn.

All disputes and differences relative to the game to be decided by the umpire, from which there is no appeal.

No ace (score) or base can be made on a foul strike.

A runner cannot be put out in making one base when a balk is made by the pitcher.

But one base allowed when a ball bounds out of the field when struck.

Read the above rules over carefully, you ardent fans of today, and picture in your mind the people of today standing for some of them. For instance, imagine, if you can, the roar that would go up if J. Franklin Baker, Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie, or any of the other heavy batters in the major leagues, batted the ball out of the field and some one or other said something of or pertaining to the said hit being a foul.

Then again, draw a mental diagram of a fielder catching a tatted grounder on the first bound and the player who made the hit being declared out.

“And again, picture what would happen if a heavy hitter hit a ball, and said ball bounded out of the field, and the batsman was only allowed one base.

Bear in mind the many different and varied cases which the National Commission has to contend with during the season, and then exercise your mental proclivities to the point of fathoming how in the world the players of yesterday stood for that clause “from which there is no appeal.”

In an effort to increase the popularity of soccer football, the National Collegiate Athletic Association some time ago collected data from various colleges all over the country, which furnished interesting facts about why the game has never reached the popularity of the American Rugby game. The canvass among the colleges, however, showed that the game is growing in interest, not so much as an intercollegiate sport, but as a game in which numerous students may take part among themselves. In this regard, the game is highly regarded among college athletic directors as a valuable adjunct to physical education.

Harvard, where the game is extensively played, furnished the information that the reason that soccer does not stand high as an intercollegiate sport is because it i$ not a game which appeals to American spectators. The Harvard report states: “It is a great game for thousands of boys and men who cannot for various reasons afford to play the American game. Soccer is well worth cultivating. Eighty years ago soccer at Harvard depended upon a few English students who had played the game before. Today we develop each year a score or more new men and have numerous teams.

The game is very popular in many colleges. At Pennsylvania, those who take part in the game are given credit for gymnasium work while practicing the game. Weekly attendance is required at the games to get credit. The report of the Pennsylvania athletic authorities stated: “It fills a place that no other game will ever take in college life and it is invaluable training.,,

SOME NOTES IN COMPULSORY PLAY.

By William A. Stecher.

In 1909, Director Haenig, principal of elementary school No. 10 in Leipzig, reported that at the beginning of the spring term 120 boys who liked to play came to the playground regularly on the Wednesday afternoon set aside for play. By the middle of the summer only one-half of the boys attended, and after vacation only 25, i. e., 21 per cent came. The clumsy, the lazv, the indifferent and the tnother’s-boys did not attend at all. Since play has been made* obligatory on Wednesday afternoons, and only excuses for good reasons will be accepted, 93 per cent of girls as well as boys attend.

In 1884 Prof. Dr. Kohlrausch in Hanover made an interesting study of the reasons for non-attendance when play was voluntary. It may be stated here that the Wednesday play afternoon has been a feature of school-life in Hanover for several generations. Prof. Kohlrausch found that if a boy is an “only” child, or if he has no sisters or brothers of approximately his age, the chances of his voluntarily visiting the playground are exceedingly small. If there are no brothers within a four-year limit only 13 per cent of such boys come to the playground regularly, 12 per cent come irregularly, and 75 per cent do not come at all.

If, however, the difference in age does not exceed four years, 47 per cent come regularly, 16 per cent irregularly, and onlv 37 per cent do not come at all. This shows that if boys grow up in an environment that is unnatural for the growing child (i. e., without companions of their own age) they are developing along anti-social lines. These boys, however, are just the ones who need the discipline which one child gives to another of its own age. They are the ones who by means of play should be taught to subordinate themselves at times to the will of a group of players of the same age. The city has a right to demand that they be subjected to the socializing influence of play, in order that they may develop into good citizens. With “voluntary” attendance nearly 50 per cent of those who grow up in like age-groups come to a playground, while of those who grow up in approximate solitude only % come to play regularly. Yet this latter group needs play most.

Objection might be made to some of the figures quoted by stating that bodily efficiency, or gymnastic abilitv might have some influence upon non-attendance at play. Prof. Kohlrausch found that of

Digitized by LjOOQle
768

the non-attendants that grow up in “social” surroundings, 20 per cent were poor in gymnastics, but that 57 per cent, i. e., nearly three times as many of those who belong to the group of “only-sons” (i. e., those living in “unsocial” surroundings) were poor gymnasts.

There is still another phase of obligatory play that should be considered; this is the effect of play upon the health of the community. In a school report for the years 1908-1909 published by the city of Pforzheim there ijTti statement relating to the number of children excused on account of sickness. The report shows that with a steadily increasing number of pupils there is a yearly increase of approximately io,oco “sick-days” per year for school children. Since the introduction of a compulsory play afternoon once a week, instead of an increase there has been a yearly decrease of 17,000 “sick-days.” Compulsory plav, it appears, during one year has eliminated 27,000 “sick-days" in the elementary schools of this city.

• It seems, further, that better health has resulted in increased resistance and power to ward off contagious diseases, for during the report year “scarlet fever” cases were reduced from 473 to 138, “diphtheria" cases from 192 to 43, and “other contagious diseases” from T94 to 29.

Tvdeed therefore from its effect upon the health as well as upon the social life of the pupils obligatory play has advantages that should not be overlooked by school men.

IV. HEADACHE.

Do you frequently suffer from headache? Normal men and women seldom suffer from headaches because they take sufficient physical exercise to avoid this discomfort. Headaches are the penalty which we are required to pay for violating nersistently some law of health. There are several t^es of headache from which many of us suffer frequently.

A dull pain in the forehead is one of the most common forms. This is generally the result of eye strain. The remedy is simple. An oculist should be consulted and proper glasses obtained to correct the defect of vision. Incidentally the person should pay careful attention to the details of personal hveiene. A simple diet of coarse food, plenty of fresh air and exercise and the snaring of the eyes as much as possible from the strain of reading will aid the oculist very much in banishing this type of headache.

769

A feeling of dull weight in the head, accompanied by a coated tongue, cold fingers and aching eyes, constitutes a second common type of headache. This form of headache is experienced by the man who obtains his nourishment from what he drinks and by the woman who believes that she can obtain her nourishment from candy, pastry and meat. To cure headaches of this kind we must realize that from this point of view there is not very much difference between excessive indulgence in alcoholic liquor and gross intemperance in the matter

Fig. 10.

of candy and pastry. Each results in a serious disturbance of the digestive functions and in the attendant headache of indigestion. Fresh air, physical exercise and a rational diet are the weapons with which this form of headache may be conquered.

A heavy pain in the temples, accompanied by an offensive breath, cold moist hands and feet, and a sense of fulness are the symptoms of the sick headache which so frequently sends a woman to her bed. A gentle emetic will give relief and abstaining from food for a short while will make the cure permanent. If interested in learning the cause of her sick headache, let the woman ask herself whether she has violated the laws of health by worrying, by too much reading, by irregular eating, by an improper or insufficient clothing of the feet, or by becoming overheated and then hurrying into the cold air of the street. By committing one or more of these offenses against good health any woman can readily acquire a* sick headache, and by carefully avoiding these indiscretions, particularly at times when she does not feel perfectly well, she can protect herself from these headaches.

Brain workers frequently suffer from headaches which are due to an insufficient or an inefficient blood supply in the brain. In most cases of headache an increase in the efficiency of the blood supply of the brain will aid in overcoming the distressing symptoms. Those suffering frequently from headaches should perform this exercise in bed before arising. Lying on your back in bed, raise your head until you can see your toes. The movement should be confined to the muscles at the front of the neck; there should be no movement of the

Fig. 11.

back. (Fig. io.) Next turn over and support the weight of your body on your toes and your elbows. Raise the head and lower it slowly until the muscles at the back of the head are fatigued. (Fig. ii.) Confine the movement to the muscles of the neck. This exercise increases the blood supply of the brain, makes the neck full and round and will reduce a double chin. If vou should become dizzy while performing this exercise, discontinue it and resume it on the following morning.

UNIFORMITY IN ATHLETICS FOR WOMEN.

Carl L. Schrader, Cambridge, Mass.

(continued.)

THE THROWING OF THE JAVELIN.

The so-called weight events for men, among which the throwing of the base ball and basket ball are not counted, have failed to arouse very much enthusiasm among women. The hammer throw has been used by comparatively few and wisely so. Even the men are gradu-

Digitized by LiOOQle
ally discontinuing this event. The discus throw has been attempted by women, but as yet not with any degree of success. Shot-putting then has been the only one event which has remained on the list of field events for women. The shot-put will be dealt with in a subsequent chapter. It is the object of this writing to make a plea for the javelin throw as an ideal throwing event for women. The weapon, and such it really is, at once incites interest, a point admittedly essential, when large numbers are to be interested. The form with which the best throws are performed as well as the flight of the weapon through the air, is attractive and at once appeals to the un-denyable esthetic sense possessed by women. Again the fact that the distance reached in the throw is more suggestive of actual accomplishment than the merely throwing overboard of the shot or discus, makes it a more exciting event. Several years of experimenting has resulted in permanently installing the javelin throw as a field event in athletics in the largest school. In no field or track event has there been so much voluntary self-practice than in the javelin throw. Even the fact that it takes prolonged practice to attain good form has not lessened the enthusiasm. The javelin is the same in weight and length as that used by men. It weighs 1.6 lbs. and measures 8.1 feet in length. At a point where it balances it is corded to serve as a firm grip. While there are numerous ways in which the javelin may be thrown, the recognized form only is to be considered here, so as to establish definite and reliable records. The regulations, aside from the javelin itself, are few. The throw is from a scratch line from which all measurements are made, perpendicularly to a point where the javelin first strikes with its spike. There is no rule which stipulates whether the throw shall be made from a stand or a run, the latter being unlimited in length. To neither method, however, may the thrower step over the scratch line until the javelin has struck. Practice is best begun by throwing from a stand and then only for form. It requires considerable practice to have the javelin stick. As mentioned above, the weapon is held by the corded handle. By placing the right foot backward, and bending the leg, the arm is brought backward almost to extension, the javelin pointing upward. From this position, simultaneously with the bending of the left knee, the Ravelin still pointing upward, is brought forward by bending and again stretching the right arm. These two positions may be repeated in alternation several times until finally, when this swaying forward and backward has resulted in a steady movement of the javelin, it is delivered from the backward position with a powerful drive obliquely forward upward.

Two common faults are easily discerned. One, that the javelin is released from the hand too soon, which will result in the javelin dropping flat, sliding, or even strike on the rear end first; the other
772

that it is held too long, in which case it overturns. Another quite common fault is that the arm, instead of rapidly bending and stretching as in a base ball throw, the arm is swung straight on nearly a horizontal plane, in which case the javelin will also turn on a horizontal plane. The position of the hand in this practice may be described as follows:	In	the	backward	position	the javelin rests in*

the almost open hand, while in the forward position it is held between index finger and thumb, resting on the middle finger (like a pen when writing). In the throw then the javelin receives its last impetus from that grasp. Once the chief elements have been mastered, each thrower will develop a pet way of holding the javelin which need not be interfered with unless it is obviously detrimental o a good performance.

The run adds but little difficulty and will easily be acquired. During the run the javelin is carried horizontally wih bent arm, the hand about the height of the ear. The position for delivery is the backward position above described and is jumped into from the run by hopping from the right on the right. The weight of the body then pivots over the left foot and the right falls on, or close to the scratch line after the delivery. This running and jumping into position is the same as in the base ball throw.

Any suggestions resulting in experimenting by others will be welcomed in these pages. The best record made in the Sargent Camp in actual competition is 82 ft. 6 inches, while 86 feet was thrown in practice.

TANGLEFOOT RELAY.

Virginia V. Hamilton, St. Louis Y. W. C. A.

Formation, as in any relay.

Apparatus, balls of different sizes.

A line is drawn at each end of the gymnasium behind which the teams are stationed. Half way between the two lines are placed a row of Indian clubs of six clubs for each team. The space between the clubs should be about twelve inches. The clubs should not stand one directly behind the other, every other club should be out of line about six inches.

000 o o o

The runners at the head of the two lines are given several balls of different sizes, and upon a signal start across to the opposite side, going through the clubs. If any clubs are knocked over, without putting balls down, the runner must stop and replace them. Upon

Digitized by Oioogle
773

reaching the opposite line the balls are placed upon the floor beyond the line and runners return through the clubs to starting line and touch hands of second runners, who in same manner run through the clubs, pick up the balls and bring them back to third runners, who stand toeing the line and ready to receive them. The race proceeds in this manner until all have run. The line which finishes first wins ,the race.

This is a very hilarious game. It has the excitement of a relay combined with the ridiculous spectacle of a player burdened with different sized balls awkwardly picking his way through the clubs. The feet actually seem to become tangled. The laughter breaks out fresh when a club is upset and the runner endeavors to replace it and not drop his balls.

SIXTH ANNUAL FIELD DAY, LANE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL, CHICAGO, ILL.

E. C. Delaporte, Chicago.

Our field days are rather unique in view of the fact that the students themselves do all the work: print the program, run off all the preliminaries to the athletic events. They also furnish all the

music for the drills and dances. (We have thirty-three pieces in the band this year). The student committees took care of all the work and only reported to the directors at stated times. The program was run off on schedule time. We regard this day as a holiday for the school. The members of the faculty sit in the grandstand and enjoy the performance. The students are exceedingly proud of their work and give their best efforts to make it a success. It is a fine example of cooperation on a large scale and brings about a high degree of loyalty to the school. The field day furnishes the proof that our work in the gymnasium aims to do the greatest good for the greatest number.

Mass Wand Drill for 2,000 Boys, arranged by E. C. Delaporte.

The students are arranged in .six columns of sixes in closed order at the rear of the field. The columns march forward preceeded by band, until each rank reaches its proper place. The ranks then are

opened sideward. The two outer files in each column begin at count one, the next two files at five, the next two at nine and all reach their respective places at ten. They then rest until count 16, giving them time to cover files front to rear and right to left. Music—“Hail to Lewiston.”

THE TEACHING OF SWIMMING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF BUFFALO, N. Y.

By Carl Burkhardt.

Second annual report showing the extent and character of uses of the five swimming pools during the vacation school period, Monday, June 28, to July 24, 1915.

The following pools were opened:—No. 1, 32, 56, 57 and 59. These pools served as centers for the entire public and parochial schools of our city. The pools were in charge of five men and five women instructors. Instruction in swimming was given to the boys from 9 A. M. to 12 at noon every day. Girls were given the exclusive use of the pools from 1130 P. M. to 4130 P. M. daily.

Each swimming instructor conducted three one-hour classes daily with a minimum enrollment of 30 pupils for each class.

The non-swimmers received two lessons weekly. Wednesday and Saturday was reserved for all boys and girls who could swim.

Every child from the 5th grade upward upon filling out a printed application, properly signed by the parent, was admitted for instruction in swimming.

Before closing of the regular day school in June, these application cards were given out, and 4,300 boys and girls were entered. The children were assigned geographically to a certain swimming center. The older ones were first enrolled into classes and the younger pupils placed on a waiting list. By this method 3,295 different individuals were actually accommodated and 1,005 placed on the waiting list.

One thousand thirty-six boys and 1,659 girls received systematic instruction in swimming; each pupil being entitled to eight lessons.

The total attendance for the four weeks or 23 days, was 15,694. This gives an average of 682 per day. (The first year the pools were operated the attendance was 11,378, or a daily average of 495.) The highest daily attendance was reached on July 1st, when 859 pupils made use of the pools. The highest weekly attendance was obtained in the third week of the summer school with an attendance of 4,362.

Before entering the pool each pupil was required to take a thorough soaping followed by a shower bath. Towels and soap were furnished by the user except in a few centers where free soap was furnished.

All instruction was given en-masse and consisted of preparatory exercises on land, then lessons on the belts, and water-wings to complete the stroke in the water; the stroke taught being the breast stroke.

Out of 3,295 pupils 2,684 were non-swimmers. The balance were swimmers who came on Wednesday, and Saturday for instruction in other strokes, as well as in life-saving. At the close of the four weeks 642 pupils or 24 per cent learned to swim free; 1,181 pupils swam correctly with the aid of water-wings. Two more weeks would have increased the number of swimmers by 47 per cent.

In addition to the activities in the swimming pool, the girls received instruction in personal hygiene by special women hygiene teachers. This was an excellent idea. No better time and place for such instruction could be found, than in conjunction with bathing and swimming.

During the last week all the children were given a practical demonstration of the right use of the cork life preservers found on all lake steamers. Pupils were also requested to impart this knowledge to their parents.

PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE

By D. M. P. KROQH, M. D., Cleveland School, Newark, N. J.

THE UNKNOWN BASIS OF MENTAL HYGIENE.

By Joseph Lee.

Author of Constructive and Preventive Philanthropyf Play in

Education.

I am going to be perfectly shameless in saying things that I have often said before, many of which I have set down in a book recently perpetrated—Play in Education. As to method, I shall proceed from the known to the unknown, and shall try in the main to state a number of propositions which may I think profitably be discussed.

I.	Health in action. It comes up out of a man,—is not conferred. It is the free operation of the force that constitutes him. To be well is to creditably represent this force. It is only by investing what strength you have, be it much or little, that you can increase or keep it. Health is not a passive condition but an active enterprise.

II.	Health is reckless action. A man must indeed choose an object reasonably within his powers. Prudence, though a dangerous quality, is not necessarily fatal if employed in moderation and, above all, if kept to its proper function of consultant in drawing up plans for future action and not permitted to interfere after the game is on. Once engaged, once the battle joined, even the sick man must let go.

As a well-inspired friend of mine once put it:	You	can't chop

wood if you keep control of the axe. To get results, either within or without, you must risk something on the stroke: you must go in to see the thing through, whether school keeps or not. Remember you are the host, and the spirit will not enter through the half-open door. To hold back anything you have is to shut out the higher powers: the gods will not embark with you until you dare commit yourself. Damn the expense is a sentiment of great therapeutic value.

This notion of a prudent prodigality, or recklessness within limits, may seem a paradox. But it is not so really. What is wanted is the ungrudging mood within boundaries prudently selected. If you cannot run a mile, run a hundred yards, or ten, or three—but run while you are about it. If you cannot work eight hours, work four or two, or one, or work like Parkman in five-minute spurts.

Digitized by LaOOQle
791

But while you are working, give your whole soul to it; think not of your weak eyes and your headache, but of the great story you have set yourself to tell. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might. Eternal moderation means health in moderation, life in moderation, if applied to your enlistment in your task.

III.	Health is action in the service of ideal ends. It is action that transcends the individual, takes him out of himself; and what carries you beyond yourself must be bi^er than you are and recognized by you as such. You must be willing to lose your life if you would save it; and you can be so willing on1v for something that you see to be worth more than your life. Hitch your wagon to a star is a third principle of sound hygiene.

IV.	The ideal ends which it is given man to serve are prescribed in the great achieving instincts (as distinguished from the physical hungers) of which his spiritual nature is made up. My own list of these instincts is creation, rhythm, hunting, fighting, nurture, curiosity and team play. These, or some not wholly different group, are the constituting instincts of man. The ideals in which they are actively promulgated give the form of the spiritual body waiting for him and into which it is given him to live up so far as he attains to life.

These seven radiating centers of the ideal are the seven stars of our spiritual firmament, our Charles' Wain, or rather the constellation to which Charles' and all of our other wagons must be hitched. They govern our spiritual anatomy and prescribe the form of health and life possible for us to attain. Our healthy specimens—the saints and heroes and men of genius who have shown what the human body can be made to do—are those who have trusted themselves to these instincts and become their temporal embodiments: warriors, artists, builders, scientists, lovers, patriots,—from Caesar, driving his frail body, in obedience to the war god in him, so far and fast even to the mastery of the world, to George Fox, sleeping in field or snowdrift, and otherwise exceeding the accepted human limitations, inspired by the flaming spirit of human brotherhood.

The actions these instincts require of us are loaded. They have a magic potency. They are abracadabras, incantations, formulas that call up the genei, terminals of great systems of power which the bold and faithful have laid hold of, and through touch with which have become live wires of the forces that control the spheres.

V.	In conclusion I want to say a word upon the task that confronts society in producing and restoring the health of its individual members; for without the co-operation of society no man can be well.

I. Most essential of all the strands of being I have mentioned is the belonging or team instinct, with its necessity of making good.

Digitized by CjOOQle
792

The health of every man requires that he shall be a loyal member, holding up his end. As a first measure of public hygiene, society

must learn again to speak in authoritative tones.....There should be

a trumpet blast of peace as well as of war. The citizen must feel that the question is not whether there is anything worth doing, but whether he can possibly measure up to the service required of him.

2. Nor can any man be well unless the service that society requires of him is of a sort in which other of the seven cardinal instincts, besides that of making good, shall find expression. The demand must be in consonance with our spiritual nature, not in violation of it.

There is at present a great difficulty here and one not immediately surmountable, if indeed it ever shall become so. Industrial civilization has removed so far from our instinctive way of living that full life and health are impossible for the great majority.

Hunting and fighting, upon which aristocracy still seeks to live, are no longer practicable as steady occupations for the great majority. Even creation has disappeared from our industrial experience except for the happy few who can win a place in the artistic trades; while scope for curiosity, or the scientific spirit, lingers only for the small minority engaged in intellectual callings. Nurture, indeed, survives in fair measure for the majority of women as mothers, teachers, nurses, and for many men as doctors, teachers and leaders.

A principal aim of civilization henceforth must be to cure this fatal evil. Only by recharging the citizen’s service to the community with the expression of other ideal ends can we restore to him his full inheritance of health.

The task will not be easy; even the direction of the necessary effort cannot be entirelv foreseen. Hunting we shall not be able to provide except on a limited scale, as a diversion, through game preservation and the substitution of the camera for the gun. Fighting in its original and most satisfying form has long been obsolete through labor-saving devices in the art of war; while in its more deadly manifestations it has always brought evils that counteract its good effects. Its idealized chivalric spirit can, however, be infused into something near its ancient form in our great team games.

Creation we can hardlv restore to industry by any method that can yet be foreseen. Ruskin’s idea of pulling down our factories and goings back to hand work is not likelv to be immediately adopted, although its adoption will b* justified if no other escape from lifeless work.can be discovered: for the end of industrial work is life, not vice versa.

Our main reliance must he: first, upon preserving competition, the sporting element in business, bv grace of which our industrial occupations, like all our favorite games, contain much of the hunt-

Digitized by C.ooQLe
793

ing and fighting elements; second, upon fostering co-operation in all forms of industry, so that the worker himself may win back as a member of the team what he has lost as maker—and perhaps even at the same time something of the sense of participation in creative work—the real maker being in that case the larger personality of which he will then be a part.

Rhythm I think must be in the main—except again in the case of the happy artists, writers, speakers and musicians—the assuaging instinct, the goddess of our leisure moments, rather than a working deity. Pegasus will still elude our harnessing.

We may, however, dream that our descendants, like the pupils in Milton’s ideal school, in their time of leisure, “may both with profit and delight be taken up in recreating and composing their travail’d spirits with the solemn and divine harmonies of music heard or learnt; either while the skillful organist nlies his grave and fancied descant, in lofty fugue, or the whole symphony with artful and unimaginable touches adorn and grace the well-studied chords of some choice composer; sometimes the lute, or soft organ-stop, waiting on elegant voices either to religious, material, or civil ditties; which, if wise men, and prophets be not extremely out, have a great power over dispositions and manners, to smooth and make them gentle from rustic harshness and distemper’d passions.”

In these ways we can do something for the health of the citizen of our industrial community. We cannot indeed' quite p-ive him back his life by making a completely normal existence possible to him. Until we can pack a full expression once more into his industrial pursuits, instead of reiving on leisure and outside sources for so much of it, that full success of public hygiene will not have been .accomplished. But we can advance some way in that direction.—T/ie Survey.

In his first lecture, on physically defective children, the doctor endeavors to show the importance of educating invalid and crippled children, to define the classes of such children for which we have to make provision, and to show what school provision has been made for them and in what ways this may be usefully extended.

According to the statements of Dr. Elmslie they have the following variety of schools and institutions in London: i. Resident Hospital Schools, 2. Resident Sanatorium Schools, 3. Country Recovery Schools, 4. Non-resident Invalid Day Schools, 5. Non-resident Open Air Schools, 6. Resident Trade Schools, and 7. Non-resident Trade Schools. The phvsically defective children are classified as follows: I. Tubercular Disease of Spine, Hip, Knee and various others; II. Infantile Paralysis; III. Spastic Paralysis (Hemiplegia, Paraplegia, Diplegia); II. Progressive Paralysis; V. Various Deformities (including Amputations); VI. Heart Disease; VII. Various Chronic Diseases (including Clorea and Phthisis) VIII. Various Slight Defects (delicate and nervous children). Altogether he enumerates 2,141 defective children, which seems to me to be a very small number for a city the size of London.

The non-resident schools for physically defective children were originally instituted in London by charity, and subsequently taken over by the Education Authority. Some of the children walk, most are collected in ambulances. The school hours are from 10 to 12 and 1:3c to 3, but as the ambulances have to do double journeys, some of the children arrive at school at g :$oy and some do not leave until 3 130, so that each child pets about four hours’ instruction in the day. At 12 a dinner is served, for which each child pays two pence. This meal is arranged by a dinner committee; which is prepared to grant dinners free or at half price in cases of poverty. During the last year the amount received in payment has completely covered the cost of the food. The cooking and serving is undertaken at the expense of the London County Council. After the dinner the children play under supervision of the school nurse and her helpers. The children are seen as nearly as possible at intervals of six months by myself or one of the other medical officers, and if any advise as regards medical treatment, food, etc., is given, this is passed on by the school nurse or by one of the managers to the parents. .	.	The

earlier manual instruction is carried out the more easily is dexterity attained. .	. In London two special trades schools for crippled

girls have been started and manual centres for boys. .	. The

hospital school for the tuberculous children and the sanatorium school, are essentials in the proper reorganization of our hospital system. There are very m?nv auestions relating to the physically defective children to which I have been unable to allude in the time at my disposal. I must, however, briefly refer to one further point,

the economic question. The majority of these children do survive whether we help them or not, by educating them we are at least helping them to support themselves to save them from being mere burdens upon the community in the work-houses and infirmaries. In the second place there is at present no proof that the children of these physically defectives are any more liable to the diseases and deformities of their parents than are the children of the healthy. With comparatively few exceptions all their defects are acquired, and in the present state of our knowledge the inheritance of acquired defects is to be denied as not proved and improbable. What is much more probable is that the crippled father, being insufficiently educated in a trade, is able to earn but poor wages, so that he and his children are in want, perhaps under the circumstances of poverty his disease recrudesces, and his children are infected. Here the lack of training will itself have brought about the evil. I am certain that the proper training of these children is in the interest of the community and should be undertaken.

The other four lectures were delivered by Dr. Emslie to the school nurses attached to the London County Council Invalid Schools and are entitled: i. Disease and Deformity of the Spine; 2. Disease and Deformity of the Hip Joint; 3. Disease of the Nervous System; 4. Rickets.

1.	The causes of round back or kyphosis are general muscular weakness and bad habits of standing and sitting. Short sight, uncorrected by glasses, deafness, and the presence of adenoids, are all contributory causes. Round shoulders are usually accompanied by a flat chest and prominent stomach. The treatment after the correction of any defect of sight, etc., is by remedial exercises. Spinal jackets are not required, and are, in fact, detrimental.

Lordosis, or hollow back, is usually secondary, that is to say, it is the result of some deformity elsewhere. Most often it is the result of the correction of a kyphosis by muscular effort, the spine becoming upright as the result of the correction of one curve by a second. Very often, however, lordosis is the result of deformity of the hip joint as, for example, in congenital dislocation. Lordosis itself practically never requires to be treated.

Scoliosis. In about one quarter of all people the spine is not quite straight, but deviates a little to one side. The spine may simply be tilted a little to one side or we may have a decided curve which causes another curve in the loins, thus establishing a double curvature. The first of these varieties is usually of little importance, readily cured by exercises and does not lead to severe deformity. The second is very important, requires expert treatment by massage and exercises with often prolonged recumbency and in some few cases the provision of a spinal support of some sort.

In regard to heart disease the Dr. says: Most of the children in school come under the class of well compensated heart cases. They may live practically a normal life, but (a) whilst ordinary exercise, play and drill is good for them, sudden over-exertion, such as running up stairs, is bad. (b) They require the greatest care to prevent recurrent attacks of rheumatism, each of which, by causing fresh disease of the valves, may make the heart worse.

There are a few badly compensated cases. You should know these by the medical officer giving directions that they are to be kept quiet. They are often a bad color—blue or pallid — get out of breath easily and sometimes have large ends to their fingers. These children should never be allowed to run, nor to do anything which makes them out of breath.

The children who are liable to fainting attacks are particularly those with disease of the valves at the root of the aorta. These also are liable to sudden death. In spite of this fact it is necessary to keep them in school, as many of them live well into middle life. On the whole, children with heart disease do badly; one-half of the deaths in our invalid schools occur amongst them. It is a good rule never to send a child suffering from heart disease away, except after a report from a doctor who knows the child, and who also understands the sort of home to which he is to be sent.

PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE.

Public Health and Personal Hygiene..Public health is made

up of units, personal health is public health, personal hygiene is public hygiene. If perfect health on the part of the farmer is considered, he will not allow milk to be dirty, allow pollution to get into the well or brook or stream. If you are working for public health you are working for personal hygiene, individual, clean, sanitary living and if each individual would follow that out public-health problems would be largely solved. Health doctors to be successful must expect to train the individuals they come in contact with in the laws of personal hygiene. —W. H. Sawyer, Journal Michigan State Medical Society.

Pedagogy Among the Chronic Insane.—E. F. Leonard, in the Institution Quarterly for September 30, reports an experience incident to his service on the staff of the Jacksonville (111.) State Hospital. An unusually obstinate patient was by degrees drawn out to take an interest in magazines and was one dky,found surrounded by

797

a group of patients to whom he was reading and explaining an arti cle. The reading circle grew and the hitherto morose patient’s condition improved. He was persuaded to start a school among the other patients of his ward. The school was taken seriously by teacher and pupils (all patients) ; a library was instituted, a singing school and Sunday School started, and the ward, which had previously been somewhat violent and hard to interest even in a daily newspaper, gradually improved. The work was in progress for about four years, during all of which time the interest was sustained. The teacher patient was finally discharged from the hospital as recovered and is now earning a living for his family.

The Medical Profession and the Eradication of Disease.—People say there must be a “nigger in the woodpile” somewhere, that the medical profession should strive to reduce illness, for it is thereby they make their living. I will acknowledge the doctor is a queer beast, but his mission in life is not to accumulate any great wealth, but to eradicate disease, and that alone will make him happy. I deny most emphatically that money is the strongest motive that moves the mass of mankind. I will admit that anything that requires money is not easily accomplished, but a good lawyer, if you will go to him with your case, will advise you in the majority of instances not to litigate, and a good preacher will try to save your soul before it gets past saving; and the good doctor rejoices much when he can keep you well.—Victor C. Vaughan, Jour, Indiana State Med. Assn.

The New Conception of the Family Physician.—While I realize that it is the ultimate aim of public hygiene to make the physician in the sense of a pill peddler superfluous, I appreciate equally well that he will be all the more needed to practice medicine in the modern sense of the word. .	.	. But where is the field of the general

practitioner, I hear some ask. He is the family adviser as he has been in the past but on a more scientific basis—he is the family health adviser if not the family physician and his relation to each of “his families” is even more sacred than in the days of old. He is expected to keep the baby well, not merely to give it medicine when ill; he is called in to examine the children of school age from time to time and to give advice as to their work and play; he is asked to pass on the health of the youthful son and daughter and find out why this loss of weight or want of appetite, and he must keep track of father and mother to see that they do not work and worry so much that their health may be impaired or their lives shortened.—Guy L. Kiefer, Jour. Mich. State Med.. Soc.

The Need of General Culture as a Condition of Progress.—In the realm of ideas there is no such thing as spontaneous generation.
798

Those who seem the originators of great movements are those who have been brought under great influences. Apparent exceptions to this rule, like Shakespeare or Darwin or Lincoln, prove, on examination, excellent examples. There is little difficulty in tracing historically the continuity of human thought. It follows that we cannot hope for a generation of original thinkers unless we immerse our students in the stream of the world's thoueht. The most inventive mind must have material on which to react, and cannot strike out in a vacuum.—Walter Libby, Science.

Habit as an Aid to Progress.—Students of Prof. H. S. Jennings' admirable work on the “Behaviour of the Lower Organisms” will remember that his experiments have led him to the conclusion that certain Protozoa, such as Stentor, are able to learn by experience how to make prompt and effective responses to certain stimuli; that after they have been stimulated in the same way a number of times they make the appropriate response at once without having to go through the whole process of trial and error by which it was first attained. In other words, they are able by practice to perform a given action with less expenditure of energy. Some modification of the protoplasm must take place which renders the performance of an act the easier the oftencr it has been repeated. This same is of course true in the case of the higher animals, and we express the fact most simply by saying that the animal establishes habits. From the mechanistic point of view we might say that the use of the machine renders it more perfect and better adapted for its purpose. In the present state of our knowledge I think we cannot go beyond this, but we must content ourselves with recognizing the power of profiting by experience as a fundamental property of living protoplasm.— Arthur Dendy, Medical Journal of Australia,

Soldiers' Feet and Footgear.—When a man's feet are sore and inflamed, but not blistered. Dr. C. Webb-Johnson says, in the British Med. Journal, it is advisable for him regularly to do one of the following: (a) Rub the feet night and morning with spirit, to which may be added I to 2 per cent, of salicylic acid, (b) Paint the tender parts once or twice a day with cither a saturated solution of picric acid or a solution of chromic acid (2 to 3 grains to the ounce), (c) After drying the feet, sprinkle with a powder composed of talc and salicylic acid (salicylic acid 2 grains, talc 1 ounce), (d) Soak the feet in a bucket of cold water to which potassium permanganate, sale, alum, tannic acid, or saltpeter has been added.

Men who complain of excessive sweating of the feet should soak them daily in a solution of formalin and water (1 to 800), dry them, and dust them with zinc oxid or some other powder. Tender

Digitized by o.ooQle
799

feet may be well greased with zinc or boracic ointment, or the soles of the feet may be soaped. When a man’s feet are normally fatigued at the end of a long march, after he has washed and dried them, he will find great relief if he lies down and raises the feet by resting them against some firm object.

If, in spite of all these precautions, a blister forms, the fluid should be exacuated aseptically and the surplus skin, liable to cause pressure cleared away. An antiseptic ointment should then be applied and the blister covered with stockingette plaster. As, after the heel, the most common situation for a blister is the plantar aspects ofthe fourth and fifth toes, it is in this case advisable to use animal wool round and under the toes to counteract the flexion which causes the pressure on these parts.

Significance of Blood-Pressure Readings in Man.—In doing blood-pressure estimations MacWilliams and Melvin find it desirable to determine the diastolic index while the armlet pressure is being raised; in some (rare) cases in which arm compression leads to a marked rise of blood-pressure, the diastolic reading taken with a rising armlet pressure may differ from that obtained during the lowering of the armlet pressure (after determining the systolic index) by as much as 20 mm. This is especially the case when simultaneous estimations are made in the two arms. But a decided effect is sometimes observed when only one arm is tested. Comparison of the diastolic values with rising and falling armlet pressures may thus give important indications of the liability of the arterial pressure to vary in an abnormal way, when a large artery is closed, as in the process of systolic estimation.

As regards the impressions derived from .digital examination of the pulse, they have found the impression gained as to (a) the tension in the vessel within the beats (diastolic pressure), and (b) the extent of the change at systole (pulse pressure^ to be specially fallacious in some cases—apparently more deceptive than the impression as to the compressibility of the pulse (systolic pressure). An enormous pulse pressure (for example, 120 mm. in a case of aortic re: gurgitation) may be present, as shown by measurement of the systolic and diastolic pressures, when the finder fails to give any adequate conception of such a pressure wave along the artery. And the measured diastolic pressure may be very high when the impression given by digital examination is that it is rather low.—British Med. Journal.

Tobacco: Alcohol.—There is no question that during the teaching of school hvgiene, during the studv of ohysiolop*v in school, and during the brief description of the action of, and the antidotes to, the more common poisons, the baneful effects of tobacco and alcohol

800

should be honestly shown. It is of no more advantage to disseminate lies in regard to these narcotics and habit-forming substances than to teach any other branch of knowledge incorrectly. The truth is bad enough. It is inexcusable for parents to give young children alcohol, but it is not wise to teach children that because their parents occasionally partake of a glass of beer or wine, they are condemned to perdition physically and morally. The higher standards of communities and the proper supervision of all places that sell liquor that is to be drunk on the premises will soon make overdrinking unusual except in the disease. The moderate use of alcohol by adults must for some time be a matter for individual decision. Youth and those under age should not take alcohol in any form, not even tinctures or caffein stimulants at the soda-water fountains.

Much more serious for the many among our young boys and young men is the overuse of tobacco. Where one young man uses alcohol perhaps twenty use tobacco. Cigaret smoking in young boys is tolerated in some preparatory schools, and even in some public high schools. In fact, a large number of young men under 21 years of age smoke excessively and to their detriment mentally and physically.

The symptoms and signs of oversmoking, the impaired chest and lung development, the impaired heart action, the impaired nutrition, injured nerves and weakened muscles are all matters of medical knowledge. These vary only in degree in young boys who overuse tobacco, and are all more or less in evidence sooner or later. Emphatically, growing boys should not be allowed to smoke, even if their fathers and teachers do.—“Prevention is greater than cure.” Journal A. M. A.

Disbanding of Rockefeller Sanitary Commission.—The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission which has had in charge the eradication of hookworm in the southern states under the fund of $1,000,000 granted by John D. Rockefeller in 1909, will disband at the close of the present year. The forces of the commission at that time will be withdrawn from all the states in which they have been working ex- . cent eight, and the work in these will be taken over by the Rockefeller Foundation, a separate organization. The foundation will close up the work in five of the eight states March 1, 1915, and the remaining three on June 30. Under the foundation there has been created an International Commission on Health which will undertake work for the promotion of health in all parts of the world in cooperation with health departments of all countries, and especially will co-operate in the constructive development of state health1 forces, not alone with reference to hookworm, but in connection with other health conditions.	■	},

THE PHYSIOLOGIC COST OF INSUFFICIENT PROTECTIVE CLOTHING *

There is perhaps no subject of such constant and vital interest, on which there are so many opinions vigorously supported, as that of clothing. As what we wear is a matter of daily choice, that we may adapt ourselves to the vagaries of weather and climate, and as each individual considers himself the ultimate judge of what constitutes comfort for himself under these varying conditions, the subject is of necessity clouded by a mass of personal, unscientific, more or less haphazard opinion. The chief popular attemnt to mould this opinion has been made, not by hygienists nor bv phvsicians, who are as rarely consulted upon this subject as upon the family diet, but by the manufacturers of special fabrics, who have bombarded the public with cleverly constructed statements of the vital superiority of their particular products. As a result of this, there are today a number of clothing cults, supported by this quasi-scientific commercial literature, advocating the exclusive use of wool, silk, cotton, or linen, in knit, mesh, or other forms of weave, and in varying weights.

In an attempt to analyze and explain the various features of personal comfort involved in the different materials and weaves, and to establish the functions of clothing, certain physiologists, notably Rubner, have made elaborate experiments. They conclude that the essential features of ideal underclothing lie in its ability to remove moisture rapidly from the surface of the body and, at the same time, to delay its evaporation at the outer surface of the clothing, in order to avoid chill. The ideal underclothing must further be sufficiently porous to give adequate ventilation to the surface of the body and must contain fibres sufficiently elastic to give a large air and moisture capacity, which they must retain even when wet, thereby avoiding clinging to the skin and loss of ventilation.

The material which in cool weather best meets these requirements in underclothing, they found to be that which Nature has developed in various forms, in her vast experimental laboratory, expressly for the protection of animal life, namely hair or wool; and its mode of manufacture to be the so-called tricot, or knit, weave. The objection to the practical use of wool which they recognize, is its first cost and its liability to be quickly ruined by shrinking when washed.

Next in value to wool, they found silk, which, although somewhat inferior to wool in certain characteristics, has the advantage of being an extremely agreeable and smooth fabric, which is not at all irritating to sensitive skins. The insurmountable objection to its general use is its very high initial cost and its lack of durability in the knit weave.

Cotton proved to be next in value to wool and silk. Cotton

802

fabric, however, is somewhat deficient in the essential characteristic of elasticity of fibre. Therefore, when used as underclothing, it has an inferior air and moisture capacity, and fails, even when dry, to conserve the body heat to the same degree as wool. When moist, its inferiority is considerably increased by the softening of its fibres and the consequent reduction of its air and moisture capacity; the ventilation of the skin, to which it tends to cling, is reduced, at the same time that the rapidity of evaporation from its outer surface is decidedly increased. The heat of the body is thereby dissipated so rapidly that chill often results.

Linen was found to be still less desirable than cotton, since it favors an even more rapid evaporation of the body’s moisture and thereby greatly predisposes to chill.

The desirable weave for all of these materials, when used as underclothing, was proven to be the tricot or knit, because of the added elasticity and porosity it imparts to the fabrics. In the case of cotton, this weave contributes a firmness which somewhat lessens its tendency to cling to the skin and to lose its porosity when moist.

The open mesh weave, Rubner found objectionable in direct proportion to the size of its holes, since it reduces the fabric’s ability to absorb and remove from the skin its excess moisture.

We naturally turn from the conflicting and confused opinions of the laity with their vagaries of habit and standards of immediate personal comfort, and the conclusions of the physiologists, which are based largely upon the physical characteristics of clothing in their relation to the heat regulation of the animal bocbr to the experience of physicians, based upon the observation of the influence of clothing upon health. In this, we naturally expect greater unanimity of ooin-ion through the generalization and elimination of individual peculiarities and the formulation of a consistent standard of clothing use from the standpoint of health.

Being unable to find any satisfactory expression of such medical opinion, I sent a questionnaire to several hundred of the most prominent medical practitioners of America, selected chiefly from Cottell’s American Men of Science. Rather more than a hundred replies were received. Of these, forty odd, while expressing great interest in the subject, frankly acknowledged total ignorance of it, and admitted an attitude based wholly upon personal predilection, since they had paid no attention to the clothing habits of their patients. More or less complete replies were received from about.sixty, and have been tabulated on the basis of positive statements only. Of these, sixty-six agreed that personal comfort was a guide to the kind and amount of clothing required. Thirty-four stated positively that cold hands, feet, nose and ears were reliable signs of insufficient clothing, barring the presence of chronic cardiac or other causative disease. Only eight considered cold extremities consistent with

Digitized by CaOOQle
803

adequate clothing and normal health. Other criteria suggested by a few were general health, resistance to disease, weight and reaction to cold.

In the selection of materials for clothing, although there was not complete unanimity of opinion on the part of those who committed themselves, wool led by more than five to one in its favor. Twenty-seven claimed that at all ages in cool climates wool was a necessary protection. Only five claimed that it was totally unnecessary. Twenty-five considered it essential as underclothing, especially in childhood; twenty-eight considered it also essential as underclothing for old age. Twenty-seven made it essential as outer clothing for all ages. As a more or less complete substitute for wool in under-clothing, sixteen favored cotton, three specifying cotton mesh; seven favored linen, four specifying linen mesh; nine favored silk; eight favored mixed wool and cotton.

In reply to the question as to the hygenic safety of the present light-weight winter clothing for women and children, thirty-seven condemned it as unsafe; four were in doubt; eleven approved of it. Among the deleterious effects stated to have been observed were an increased tendency to colds and minor illnesses, poor sleep, lowered intellectual efficiency, decreased growth and development. Twenty-two expected from it decreased, while two expected increased, resistance to disease.

In choice of room temperature, greater unanimity of opinion is apparent, in that only one called for a temperature above 730 F., whereas forty-one chose a range of 6o° to 70°, with a marked tendency in favor of 67° to 68°. The remaining eighteen were non-commital, with the exception of four, who thought higher temperatures at times necessary, unless the great dryness of indoor winter air was neutralized by additional moisture.

The following diseases were recognized as having, in their experience, been associated with inadequate protective clothing: bronchitis, by 30; nasal catarrh, by 27; pneumonia, by 26; pleurisy, gastro-enteritis and rheumatism, bv 22; nephritis and tonsilitis, by 19; tuberculosis, by 18; middle ear and antrum inflammation, by 16; catarrhal jaundice, gastritis, rheumatoid arthritis and imperfect nutrition, by 44; retarded growth, bv 13; dyspepsia and neurasthenia, by 10; osteo-arthritis and villous arthritis, by 8. Thus many physicians are seen to recognize as results of under-protection by clothing, not only acture catarrhal troubles, but also remote and essentially chronic organic, joint, and nervous ailments, which, in their inception, may in no wise affect the individual’s immediate sense of comfort and against which he may not therefore guard himself.

A large proportion of the prominent physicians who replied to my questionnaire would thus seem to be in agreement with the find-

Digitized by
804

ings of the physiologists, that wool is the superior material for clothing and that it is a necessary safeguard of health.

Their conclusion would appear to be borne out by the practical experiences of men in the more trying branches of labor, where disability is quickly shown, as firemen on steamships and workers in foundries and other places in which perspiring men are exposed to cold drafts of air. I remember, for example, a foundryman coming to my clinic with a markedly painful spinal osteo-arthritis, who, when questioned as to his habits of clothing, replied that, when he went into the foundry, the workmen all advised him to wear wool underclothes and warned him that otherwise his back was sure to become crippled. Because of poverty and a large family, he wore heavy cotton instead, with the result of being permanently incapacitated for heavy work at the end of a few years. This is only; one of many instances which have come under my observation and have convinced me of the causal relation between inadequate protection bv clothing and remote ailments of rheumatoid or arthritic type, which are not generally recognized as being thus associated.

The deleterious effects of inadequate clothing are not confined to adults. There is a type of child, poorlv nourished and generally under-developed in strength and endurance, with poor appetite and constantly subject to miner ailments, who is popularly diagnosed as having poor circulation because of habitually cold extremities. We often see in this class marvelous improvement as a result of changing to wool underclothing, sufficient in amount to keep the hands and feet warm. Unfortunately, the change is often attributed entirely to the tonic medicine which the doctor usually gives at the same time.

Many oersons, especiallv women, are content to go through life with cold extremities, accepting the popular verdict of poor circulation. because thev experience no particular discomfort, on account of the essential exhaustion of the terminal sense organs for cold in the extremities. In this case we frequently find developed, usuallv after the years 30 to 35, many cases of painful joints, esoec-ially of foot, ankle, knee and hand. The joints, on examination, freque^tlv show distinct enlargement, that is, are osteo-arthritic in nature. Tn some, the enlargement is very slight and its sensitiveness greatly in excess of that seemingly warranted by the phvsical condition. We find further many cases of nervous irritability, ranging from the “nervous stomach” to distinct and painful neuritis of persists tvpe.

This multitude of cases, such as* painful joints in women and children, colic, especially in young children, nervous states seem-inglv oh-Qcure in their origin, malnutrition, sleeplessness, general irritahih'tv, and neuritis, which are ameliorated or even cured bv a change to warmer clothing, constitute a mass of positive evidence

Digitized by c.ooQLe
805

which no amount of personal prejudice or negative experience would seen competent to overthrow. Negatively to argue that dozens of people are seemingly able to maintain their normal equilibrium for years in spite of inadequate clothing is far from proving either that they may not later pay with years of suffering, or that dozens of others do not pay earlier in life. It is the argument used to prove alcohol incapable of harm, because some drunkards live to be eighty.

That, notwithstanding this positive evidence, there yet exists today so much ignorance and conflicting opinion on the subject of under protection by clothing and its physiological cost (it will be remembered that out of over one hundred prominent physicians, nearly half expressed their ignorance of the subject) is undoubtedly due to our failure carefully to study the etiology of chronic diseases, and especially, to get adequate histories of the clothing habits of our patients. The situation is now further complicated by the great emphasis being laid upon the stimulating effect of cold and the miracles it performs, with the result that we are in danger of being swept off our feet in oun indiscriminate use of this powerful agent. We are in danger of forgetting that, like most so-called stimulants, it has another and antagonistic side. Brief applications of cold, especially when alternated with heat, are marvelously stimulating to the nutritive processes and nerve control of the body. They train its heat-regulating apparatus to broaden the range of safe exposure to variations of temperature, and under such training, the body unquestionably becomes better able automatically to protect itself.

This use of cold as a stimulant and trainer of the automatic processes of the body is, however, a very different matter from the keeping of any part of the body constantly at a temperature below the normal of 98.50F. Under these conditions, the delicately controlled heat-regulating mechanism at once acts in defence of the vital organs by partially excluding the blood from the extremities where it is being overcooled. The result is that the tissues of the extremities are kept in a state of anemia and chill. This means in a certain percentage of cases, but apparently not of necessity in all, that the nutritive conditions in bone, nerve, muscle, tendon and other tissue, are so changed that wholesome development and maintenance may be impossible. In this depressed condition, cellular activity is often so seriously impaired that the weak spot in the individual is made manifest, as in the form of overgrowth of tender bone around the joints, or of an abnormally irritable state of the nerve terminals and trunks. The cold, instead of being a stimulant, h^s now become a depressant of serious menance to comfort and health.

The normal warmth of the entire body, on the contrary, means the maintenance of cell activity at its maximum efficiency

806

through the presence of a rich blood supply, and renders the body most resistant to disease.

It thus appears that each individual has to consider whether or not, through adequate clothin^ he will insure himself against the risk of illness or of prolonged discomfort and inefficiency during the later years of his life. It would seem that the safest form of insurance had been shown by physiologists and physicians and by the practical experience of men under trying temperature conditions, to be wool clothing for cool weather, since by its use the body has been found to be fully protected. The expense of this insurance has by many been considered prohibitive, not because of its first cost, but because the life of the porous wool undergarment is so shortened by shrinkage in washing. This objection I have proved to be easily obviated. For the past ten years, my family and I have worn ill winter pure wool unions, of varying weights, a form of garment which cannot be worn when even slightly shrunk. By using ammonia in wash water of blood temperature and a so-called wool soap and by avoiding rubbing except lightly with the hands, we have not been able to discover anv shrinkage or loss of original softness and pliability. Garments originally bought large, of heavy weight and pure wool, have remained too large even after, several years of use, and garments of exact fit have remained so. From the standpoint of economy, therefore, judged by its yearly cost as an insurance against financial loss through illness and inefficiency, knit wool underclothing must be considered remarkedly cheap.

From the standpoint of the possible physiological cost of inadequate clothing in lowered vitality, we must consider it extremely fortunate that nature, by its ages of experimentation to develop for animal life the best protection against wet and cold, has provided the human animal with so adequate a protective material.

In view of the fact, however, that there is so much confusion in the popular mind on the subject of proper protection by clothing and so much neglect and difference of opinion on the part of phvsi-cians, and that the positive evidence of dis^bilitv through underprotection, now at our disposal, is too isolated and fragmentary to be considered fully authoritative, it would seem that the great practical importance of the subject demands that it be more adequately studied in the future.

Since positive evidence of clothing effects upon patients under the observation of physicians furnishes the most valuable data for this study, I shall be verv grateful to any phvsicians who are willing to cooperate with me bv sending to me pertinent clinical reports of observed cases or the results of their observations along the lines indicated in the following questionnaire:—
