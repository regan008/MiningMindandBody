THE ATHLETIC LIFE OF THE GERMANS.

By FELIX L. SENFF.

(Translated from the New York Staatszeitung by Lorle Stecher.)

I had been told much of the modern changed Germany—for I had not seen Germany for twenty years. I found upon closer observation many things that corresponded rather to representations directed by love for the Fajherland than to objective reality. I found, also, many things that surpassed my highest expectations. Nothing, however, astonished me so much as the devotion to all forms of sport that is shown by every class of society in Germany. .

When a company of officers, young lawyers, older country gentlemen and shrewd manufacturers—not to mention the ladies—broke out into a regular Harvard-Yale jubilation as they sat at their wine and coffee tables at Gobelsbach merely to hear the news that a German tennis player had beaten the English champion—it was no wonder I asked myself:	“Where	is	the	Germany	of	poets	and	philosophers?

When the mayor of a provincial town in Thiiringen invited me to a football game between his team and that of a neighboring village and saw gathered at the field half of the population including workmen, and heard football talk from High School professors and head mistresses, was it any wonder I asked myself “Am I on Broadway U. S. A. or in Central Germany where in my time turning was pretty much the only sport■?”

I should not like to say that the German is a born sportsman as is the American. The German likes to eliminate the hazardous, the foolhardy. He takes his sport as earnestly, and pedantic as his science and his learning. But be does not scorn football, tennis, golf. On the contrary lie does everything with a passion, and overdoes it as the Americans and English do. Football, for instance, which is regarded in America by those who do not wish to recognize it, as a training for rowdyism, is highly valued by the younger generation in Germany. To be sure they play it more quietly; they have taken out of it the more brutal features: but it is everywhere played. One finds everywhere teams, the members clad in that half undress that is “so American.7"

Villages challenge one another and the games are widely advertised and largely attended by the general public. There was only one American game I did not find—baseball. That will come too, "for the German likes to adopt everything that is English-American—even the sporting terms, the athletic costume and the shoes.

From America, especially from Canada, lie has taken over the tobogganing from North America and Scandinavia the ski and snow shoes. These sports are especially popular in Austria and Switzerland. Everywhere in the mountains one sees the sign “Rodelbahn” (toboggan slide). Steep hills are highly valued for this purpose; they are shown the summer tourists as notable sights. I saw such a slide on the Semmering near Vienna said to be a thousand meters long, and I bought a picture of it, as all tourists do.

Miirren, the fresh-air-cure resort in the highlands of Bern,' whose winter season is more lively than its summer season—and Oberhof on the plateau of the Thuringer forest erect monuments to the victors in toboggan and ski races and build expensive slides for these contests. He who is not proficient with toboggan and ski does not count at all with the younger set.

What about training? That has its place too, but it counts rather as military drill. The other things have become the national 6ports in the true sense of the term. In hilly parts of the country the entire population indulges in these sports.

I overheard at a popular concert in the Loewenbraeu Keller in Miin-chen, the conversation of a company of young people—obviously saleswomen and clerks—about the attainments of their Ski-club where in former years, the talk was probably of the deeds of their drinking societies. The .sport is by no means confined -to the wealthy at their winter resorts and elegant hotels.

In the summer the people all become “Wandervoegel” (migratory birds, the official name of the great German tramping club). With knapsack on back they set out to climb the mountains—men, women and children. Perhaps the Wandervogel is resposible for the pleasing appearance of the German women, for their healthy complexions. They have not the interesting pallor that, in America, is supposed to lend distinction, hut they look healthy, that's sure. The cause of this is, doubtless, the outdoor life, the almost Spartan manner of the life of the Wandervoegel on their tours which often last weeks.

Where the knapsack is seen bv the thousands one finds rosy cheeks.

« Even wealthy German women, who play an important part in social life in the winter, take their pleasure in the summer in these long tramps or in shorter week end excursions with husband and children. 'Everywhere one meets school children, accompanied by their teachers. They are taught, out-of-doors, lessons in observation, in natural history and the story of the Fatherland.

On the large terrace of the Heidelberg Castle where there is an unobstructed view of the Xeckar Valley I met the pupils of a school from Karlsruhe. They had come from there by train in order to learn in sight of the proudest ruins of Germany the story of the oppressions of the war with Orleans—1689—1693. Then they went to the Koenigs-
— 43 —

stuhl, and in Frankfurt in the Cathedral where the German Kaisers were crowned; and in the Taunus J met them again.

To go back to atlijetics, tennis is perhaps played more in Germany today than in America. Every half way modern town has magnificent courts. 1 saw in the Palm Gardens at Frankfurt—not to speak of the baths and summer resorts—a scene so animated and colorful, players so numerous and skillful that one would have believed oneself in Central Park on a Saturday afternoon. I saw in Heidelberg and Freiburg students with gaily colored caps hasten from fencing to tennis while we formerly would have gone to have some afternoon refreshment. It is considered necessary for the bon ton that one be able to play excellent tennis. Golf is still confined to the health resorts which are visited mostly by foreigners but in Baden-Baden I saw a notice of the “great German tournament” between the champions of England, America, Russia and Germany.

The Germans appear to have taken over everything. Boxing is a recognized sport. In a town on the Elbe I saw a “cock-fight” advertised and the police did not interfere. Swimming and rowing have long been popular. One sees now-a-days stately yachts on the Alster at Uhlenhorst and on the Weser, while on the Muggelsee at Berlin whole flotillas of row' boats are ready for the races.

The Germans have thoroughly adopted the “outdoor life” of the Americans. Even the workingmen's summer colonies found everywhere near the cities show this. These “Schreber Gaerten” consist of tents in the midst of a bit of land on wrhich flowers and vegetables are cultivated by the campers. Even here is indicated the modern tendency of the Germans who seem to be preparing themselves in this way for any conflict which might arise and in which only a nation strong in body and mind can succeed.

EDUCATION OF THE BODY BY TRAINING THROUGH EXERCISE

By CHARLES B. LEWIS, M. D.

Director of Physical Education for Boys, Worcester High Schools.

Training means to form by practice, to educate, to master. Physical training then, is the education of the body through exercise. The underlying principles of education, whether it be mental, moral or physical, are the same; for the aim in each case is to develop power. Now, in order to gain power we must first be educated or acquire knowledge. Education is the attempt at realization of an ideal and may rightly be viewed under the following aspects:—physical, moral and intellectual. These well defined divisions are so intimately connected, that the improvement of one contributes to the strength of the other; if one is injured or benefited the other is directly or indirectly affected. , The developing process is analogous to the improvements made upon machinery, the increase in out-put being parallel with the augmented efficiency of the individual. Each part of the human machine produces a corresponding degree of perfection from the harmony or working together of the parts. In building up the physical qualities, we strengthen the mental and preserve and piotect the moral. The good

condition of all parts are necessary to the perfect integration of the whole. If we revert to the Greeks, we find that their ideal of education was symmetrical development; that is, mental, moral and physical power. The body was not developed at the expense of the mind, but the mind in its activity was related to the body. It was Plato who - said, “To educate the mind and neglect the body is to produce a cripple/' The Greeks studied life not death. The human body is an organization in action; both mind and body are integral parts of the same machine and must work together.

The aim of physical training is to develop maii to his highest efficiency and to what nature intended him to be. We study mart through what he manifests in his body. “'Tis not a soul, 'Tis not a body, we are training up, but a man, and we ought not to divide him/* By training the body through certain neuro-muscular activities, we are able to attain normal development. There are various ways in which we may train our bodies. We have baseball, football, tennis, swimming and many other out-of-door sports; but these do not come within the reach of all. To meet this need we have turned to the gymnasium to obtain the necessary training for the development of the body. Physical training is as important a factor in complete life as eating. Doubtless eating would often he neglected if nature had not provided for man's negligence by warning him with hunger. The neglect of physical training also has its warnings and unless these warnings are heeded, -we realize, very often too late, that the body has been damaged beyond repair. It is man's social duty to have a vocation or to ply some trade; but he also owes it to himself to have an avocation. Some people pursue physical training as a vocation, while others look upon it merely as an avocation. In fact, every one should have some diversion from the regular routine of his calling. The manual laborer would not require as much physical training as the man who leads a sedentary life; a man's work and play should be well balanced.

Exercise means practice, exertion for training or improvement. So it is through exercise that training is effected. When exercise originates in interest, we secure the best results; for here we find co-ordination of the powers of the entire system. Often we hear people say* “They do not need physical training, they have exercise enough in the pursuit of their calling." There is no kind of manual labor that calls into play all the parts of the body in relation to the whole body. Therefore, we look to the training of the body through systematic exercise to establish this relationship. Well ordered physical exercise should seek the attainment of a rounded development. It tends to make the person well poised and the sensitive organism respond to the feelings and purpose of living. Bousseau says,—“The weaker the body the more it commands; the stronger the body the more it obeys. A feeble body weakens the mind. If you desire your pupil should improve in mental abilities, let him improve the corporeal strength which is subject to their direction. Let his body have continued exercise." Because of this demand for systematised training certain exercises are selected and practiced to attain the desired end.	•

It is well to consider for a moment the character of a muscle, and the influence of exercise upon it and its nervous'connection. When a

— 45

muscle is forced into action, the flow of blood into it is stimulated and through the dilation of the arteriolae, more blood is poured into the capillaries, which surround the fibres. There is also a corresponding increase in blood flow away from the muscle through the veins toward the heart. Should the arterial bloodsupply to a muscle be obstructed or reduced, its inherent contractile quality is lowered, when this happens it requires a stronger stimulus to make it contract. Other conditions such as:—impure air, which produces blood lacking in oxygen, or containing poison; or failure to remove waste products from the system may bring about a condition of lowered irritability requiring a greater stimulus. Prolonged or excessive stimulation of a muscle will lower its irritability even when there is no obstruction in its blood vessels. This shows that the main conditions for the health of a working muscle are, a full supply of oxygen and unimpeded and sufficient drainage. These conditions can be obtained by proper exercise. A trained healthy muscle’ can do more work than an untrained muscle, because its size, strength and capacity have been increased and the response to stimulus is more prompt. The chief effects of exercise on a single muscle, or upon the whole muscular system, are growth, or increase in size of its structure, and development, or increase of its functional activity. The most important object of muscular exercise is the functional improvement of the nervous mechanism which directs all movements, whether they be simple or complicated, reflex, automatic or voluntary. Such functional improvement may be accomplished through trial and repiti-tion. An action which at first is a difficult- feat, soon becomes a pleasurable accomplishment, then a routine performance and eventually an almost instinctive act.

A good muscular development will give strength and rapidity of motion, while if the body fails to receive exercise, the muscular system becomes inactive and weak; the flesh soft, energy fails, and the excretory organs cease to perform their proper functions. Health is the harmonious action of the processes of respiration, circulation, digestion, assimilation and elimination. Consequently it will vary with the degree of vigor and harmony with which these processes are carried on. It is the cohdition of the involuntary muscles that determines the degree of health. If these muscles are strong and active, vigorous health is assured their possessor. This strength and activity will not continue of itself; it requires frequent reinforcement, and nature has wisely arranged that it shall be supplied by action of the voluntary muscles. ^Regular and judicious exercise of the voluntary muscles is, therefore, the natural and proper means to good health.

It is impossible to form a schedule of exercises for universal use. But stereotyped schemes of physical training like “the ideal diet” have certain general bases. It should be of such a nature as to destroy and renovate tissue; to promote functional activity; to give tone to the muscular system; in general, to promote nutrition, circulation, health, strength and endurance. It should be begun moderately, gradually increasing in degree of vigor. It should be sufficient in quantity, but never carried to a point of exhaustion or even fatigue. It should be of good quality so as to yield the benefit commensurate with the amount

— 46 —

of effort put forth. It should have sufficient variety to stimulate the interest; all parts should be exercised in proper proportion, so as to acquire a symmetrical development. Both the selection and order of . arrangement of exercises must be determined by individual needs; otherwise they are not" likely to prove especially helpful and may be productive of harm. What these individual needs are depends upon the condition of the system and the defects which may have been either inherited or acquired. But whether inherited or acquired, there are forms of remedial exercises which if begun in time and intelligently applied and used, are able in many instances to correct and improve the discovered abnormalities.

As we have already suggested training is a means to an end. Physical training to be made most beneficial, physiologically, should be supplemented by good habits and hygienic conditions of life. Proper air, water, food, bathing, clothing, rest and sleep, sanitary conditions, regulation of the nervous activity, use of narcotics and stimulants, are all matters to be considered. A prevalent mistake in physical training is the tendency to over-exercise. This exerts the muscles beyond their power and finally causes their destruction. Thus the muscle instead of increasing in strength, decreases in size, and may finally lose its power. For while insufficient exercise or none at all, prevents natural development of the organs, depriving them of their ability to perform their functions, over-exertion, too vigorous exercises wears out the tissues too rapidly, not giving nature time to repair the waste. But moderate exercise, well selected, regulated and directed, with proper nutrition, strengthens the body.

As Dr. Sargent of Harvard says:—“The object should be not to develop a runner, a jumper, a boxer, a ball-player, an oarsman, a gymnast, but the highest type of a physically perfect man. This forbids excessive development in any one direction. The great thing to be desired is that prime physical condition called fitness—fitness for work, fitness for play, fitness for anything a man may be called upon to do.”

In conclusion then, it becomes evident from what has been said, that skill and culture of the body come by training through exercise. Training and exercise are complementary, as the two blades of a pair of shears. One is useless without the other and both blades must be working in harmony to function properly. So it is with the dual demands for development of the human body. Moreover, anv educational system that neglects or under-estimates the value of bodily training is unnatural and contrary to the law of symmetrical development. Scientific training consists of classified truths of a field of human activity put into practice. It is common sense writ large, the guide to the making of a more perfect human being, the striving for a growing ideal.

Ideals and habits must be developed early in the child so that as a person comes to maturer years, he may derive some pleasure from his exercise. The child should be made acquainted with or trained in all healthful forms of physical activity, while in the grammar schools; in the same manner as he is drilled in what are generally known as fundamentals in school work. Physical training must seek recogni-

tion from the municipal as well as the national government, with the avowed purpose of aiding in the campaign of education, so that eventually all institutions may adopt a comprehensive system of education which shall consider man as an entity.

EFFICIENCY IN AQUATICS/

By GUS LINDNER, Rahway, N. J.

During the past year a number of our Associations have been conducting swimming campaigns to teach all boys of the city how to swim, which, I believe, is a splendid thing and meets with the approval of the committee and the parents as well.

Teaching a boy or man how to swim is doing something definite for him, and makes it possible for him to teach others, and to rescue those who are in danger of drowning.

Some time ago a swimming campaign was held at the Orange Association. As a result of the campaign, 404 boys out of 500 learned to swim, and 125 of them swam 50 feet. Added to this the Association took in over fifty new members; was it all worth while? Surely. Here is a splendid chance for our swimming committee to get busy and show these boys how they can advance step by step by the right kind of practice to become good swimmers, and be of some assistance to others in need. I believe the Association with a first-class swimming pool is neglecting a great responsibility, if it does not train men and boys in high-class swimming and instruct them in the methods of life-saving.

The boy who learns to swim should not be neglected, but should be encouraged to practice all the methods and requirements to become efficient in the art of rescue work.

I saw the need of well-trained swimmers more than ever before when I noticed the large number of people who are drowned while bathing and boating.

Last summer at Rahway I organized a life-saving corps among the high school students’ division from our Association. I selected about forty huskies between seventeen and twenty years of age, and had them go through a certain test as follows:

' 1. 440-yard swim in ten minutes.

2.	100-yard swim on back.

3.	Carry or tow another person your own weight 50 feet.

4.	Swim 50 feet with coat, pants and shoes on.

5.	Dive and get a ten-pound stone out of ten feet of water.

They all got busy right away, and got some fine practice instead

of playing tag, rough-housing and cutting up in the water.

The fellows went to the beach when they wanted to, but had to agree to render any assistance at any time at any place they happened to be when they saw anyone in danger of drowning.

The Life-Saving Corps was organized about July 1, 1912, and during the three months of July, August and September, the fellows did splendid service, and were the means of rescuing ten people from drowning. They also taught a number of “sink easies” how to swim.

* From “Physical Training” Jan. 1913.

What we want to do is to train men and boys for service and leadership. A person cannot teach others until he has been taught and trained himself. Teach a boy to become efficient in the art of swimming; train him in the methods of life-saving; then he will have confidence in his ability to perform and can be relied upon when, he is called on to render a definite service.

We have gymnasium leaders, why not swimming leaders? They would do splendid service, and greatly assist the work in the physical department. This would dignify our work, and take in the whole department.

The swimming chart could be hung in a suitable place, where all the boys could become familiar with the various requirements for each class, and as they become acquainted with the requirements, it would stimulate interest among them in aquatics, and they could find out by practice in which class they belonged. The bov should be sure that lie can perform all the various stunts in the class for which he signs.

The Physical Director is to oversee and have charge of appointing the swimming committee and the swimming team, with the assistance of the Boys’ Work Director.

The Swimming Committee is to report to him once a month; the try-outs and promotions will be held semi-monthly; one for Juniors about the first of the month, and one for Intermediates about the fifteenth of the month. This is for the Boys’ Department. Seniors and Employed Bovs follow the same program, using the swimming pool in the evening.

Every boy or man is to remain in one class at least one month.

None but Class A boys or men. Junior or Senior life savers are * to be appointed on the Committee or Swimming Team.

SWIMMING LEADERS AND EMBLEMS.

The Junior Life Savers are to have two small letters on their gymnasium shirt, S. L. in red, which stands for Swimming Leader.

The Seniors are to have three letters in blue, S. L. S., which stands for Swimming Leader Senior, or Senior Life Savers.

INSTRUCTORS.

Class A swimmers to teach, judge and report for classes G and F.

Junior Life	Savers	to teach,	judge and	report	for	classes E and	D.

Senior Life	Savers	to teach,	judge and	report	for	classes C and	B.

The boys or men have two weeks to find out in which class they belong, and must then hand in their names and class to the Boys’ Secretary, or if he is a member of the Senior Department, to ihe Senior Physical Director.

A typewritten list of the names will be made and placed under the chart in the class to which they belong, to remain there for one month, or until	the man or boy	graduates	into a	class higher up.-	If

we	can graduate a boy	from the	“sink-easy” class	up	to the Junior	or

Senior Life Saver, I know we are doing something worth while, for we have not only benefited the boy for the time being, but have given him something which will be of benefit to him all his life. This will enable him to render valuable service to persons in danger of drowning.

and give him the ability to teach' others to swim and the methods of

life-saving.

The object of this plan is. to train boys and men step by step along the right lines to become efficient swimming leaders and life savers. •What is demanded today is efficiency along every line., as there is a great need for life savers everywhere.

If a person who wishes to qualify as a life saver has not become acqnainted with his ability by previous practice, he might overstep his-limitations and perhaps come to grief. To save a human life from drowning requires courage and ability. One of the most important things to know in life-saving is how to approach and take hold of a struggling person. If a life saver cannot dive into deep water and see* and find objects under water; if he cannot swim on his back; and if he cannot swim for some distance under water, he is a failure as a life saver. He should be able to swim with clothing on, and if necessary,, be able to disrobe in the water. He should be able to do air these things to qualify as a first-class life saver.

Percentage Table for “Proficiency Swimming,”

Season 1912 and 1913.

Proposed by Jos. 1. Smith, M. D.f Swimming Committee, Phila. Turngemeinde.

To compute each man’s average; First make up the Percentage list from the Standard or Scratch man, to the Limit man. In this case it ranges from one minute and seven seconds to one minute and twenty-five seconds. This allows the 1.07 man ten points, and the 1.25 man one point. Count every two seconds, as one point from 1.25 to 1.07 Every second, one half point and every two fifths, one quarter point. Every second better than 1.07 will count one point.

It is easier for a 'swimmer to improve his record between 1.25 to 1.07, then a 1.07 man to improve one second below his record.

In practical use, 1st take the swimmer's record, handicap him, to bring him up to the scratch line.

2nd. Count two seconds of his handicap, as in the percentage table.

4th. Compare his time with number on the percentage table, this will give the number of points actually made.

5th. Add the number of points made with the number of points awarded in his handicap, this will give the total number of points.

No repetition; exercises lead directly to II. Pupils are to be cautioned not to get out of their files (keep correct alignment) during all dancing steps.

Should the condition of the ground necessitate it, the first movement of the mazurka hop may be changed, a step sideward (with knees slightty bent) being substituted for the glide sideward. In the forearm strike hold and in the side hold the elbows should be kept well back. Trunk lowering forward is to be executed to the horizontal position, the spinal column being kept as straight as possible (flat back). Upper trunk bending backward is a movement in the upper spine; bending at the waist line (lumbar spine) is to be avoided as much as possible.

—CAN THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES or the courts compel a child to attend an open air school when the pupil, with the approval of its parents would prefer to attend the regular school? This question was decided recently in a police court in New Britian, Conn. A father was arrested for failing to send his children to school. In the court it developed that the children had attended school regularly until they were directed to go to the new open air school which the city had established. After a few days at the open air school the children complained of being cold during school sessions. Then their father told them to go back to the regular school again where they were refused admittance, because they had been transferred. The result was that the children attended no school. After deciding that the compulsory education law could not be made to apply to the open air school, the court paroled the children in the charge of a probation officer.

In New York, the parents must consent before children are admitted to the fresh air classes for anaemic children, and they may withdraw their children and put them hack in the regular school. In the case of children with open tuberculosis, however, the Health Department requires that they be segregated from other children, and the Board of Education exacts compulsory attendance at an open air school, if they are physically able.

EDUCATIONAL AND HYGIENIC VALUE OF PLAY.

(From Public School Report, Cambridge, Mass., 1912.

The first thing we should understand about play is that it is a serious business for the child, that when playing with heart and soul it is acquiring experiences much more rapidly and is storing away knowledge much more thoroughly than when under compulsion.

We should understand that play does not mean only playing with a ball, or playing with a* certain toy, but that it really means any form of spontaneous enthusiastic intense application to ahy kind of manual or mental work. The younger the child, the more valuable as a brainbuilding agent are all kinds of motor-experiences. Any work, may it be sand play, gardening, building a doll house, fashioning Indian weapons, propelling wooden boats, climbing trees, throwing stones or swinging ropes, becomes a most valuable agent for the development of the motor-brain of the child. In the consideration of fundamental brain powers these motor-experiences are of the very profoundest importance since there cannot be any brain power without muscular experiences. With the ever narrowing circle of the home environment of our children and the disappearance of occupations requiring all-round physical activities, with the disappearance of home chores and home making,, and the absence even of creeping space for babies, we must now almost artificially provide more motor-experiences for young children. This is especially emphasized with the^ boys on account of the enforced absence of the father from home who up to one or two generations ago more or less unconsciously stimulated his boy to a richer motor life by his “doing things” in the home. In our public schools we try to remedy this loss by all kinds of manual training. This is, of course, good'as far as it goes, but it is not early enough in the child’s life. He should first have manual play, lots of it, and he should have it spontaneously and not too much under compulsion. Again, he should have more of it out-of-doors with the help of Mother Earth, the trees and the water. There should he on every playground an old fashioned farm yard which would offer “lots of things to look after.”

Hygienically there is nothing better for children than real wholesome muscular activities out-of-doors. The changed environments, the joyous atmosphere of many children at play under the open sky, with the wind blowing, is always attractive to children especially if not hampered by too much clothing. (There should be locker rooms for superfluous clothing. There is today hardly need for arguing in favor of more outdoor work, but there is still much need of a better, understanding by the general public of the high educational value of motor-ac-. tivities in the development of an efficient central nervous system, and the great influence which organized play may exert in the building of character. Here we learn to know the real child—the child as he .unbends during spontaneous action, and he unfolds during intense application and when close to nature. The schoolroom child is a product of an artificial environment. The playground child is a product of
— 75 —

fundamental emotions an<J hereditary instincts. To get hygienic results with normal children no means can possibly surpass in value such vigorous outdoor activities as running, leaping, skipping, bending, twisting and reaching, especially if they are the results of spontaneous interest and unconscious application. We have, therefore, in the plays and games of children and the sports and athletic activities of youth a most excellent agent in maintaining physiological efficiency.

Play as a method of recreation and of physical training is unsurpassed, because it uses established co-ordinations and fundamental mnseles, especially if a variety Jof games are practiced. It develops vital and functional strength rather than mere muscular strength, on account of the large extent to which the majority of the big groups of muscles are involved. It is at least equal to gymnastics as far as these are used as preventive measures, because play and games are a fundamental demand in. the life of young children, and it is only because school interferes too much with these fundamental elements of child-life that later corrective gymnastics become necessary. If our educational methods and laboratories and machinery conformed more to elementary child life, less corrective measures would be needed.

But we appreciate also, since the advent of experimetal psychology and pedagogy, that a rational, wholesome, safe and sane motor-life throughout childhood affects beneficially not only the child's health, in the commonly accepted sense of^this term, but that it affects equally as favorably the intellectual and moral life.

We appreciate more than ever that moral strength is dependent •upon physical health, that character is in the main a “Plexus of motor habits," that “Man is what he does," in other words, we know that in order to be really efficient men, we must not only be healthy in body but must have a healthy and rational mind. Rational, safe and sane mentality, is the outcome of a rational motor-life, i. e. rational play-life. The experiences of childhood determine to a large extent our habits and our character.

Plato said, “The play of children has the mightiest influence on the maintenance or non-maintenance of laws." It is this emphasis on the benefit of play, this great ethical force, which the judges qf juvenile courts see in the playground activities, and it is for this reason that I believe we should make play a part of our school education. Unlike othey cultural agencies, for the development of the moral side of * man, we return to the fundamental activities of the body to get the highest type of character. If we once appreciate that mind, body and soul are interdependent, we shall see that the soul can best be reached through well directed and organized physical activities in which the whole child is interested. Physical education offers more opportunities for ethical culture than any other ethical agency because it never separates these three parts. Through play, the mind accumulates knowledge;- by learning to abide by rules and laws of the game, we strengthen the will; by playing “fair" we develop character; by conquering odds, we grow in courage; by supporting our mates, we foster co-operation. It is by “playing the game" that one acquires chivalry, fosters civic virtues, and develops loyalty.

Self-management of play is the only management worth having. To bring this about, our play teachers must not only have the right point of view, but also the right capacity for organization. To organize the children into self-managing group units around various and diversified activities must be our main purpose. This will insure the broadest possible ethical influence. If our play leaders are merely teachers, if they merely direct the entertainment of the children, without bringing them hourly nearer the goal of self-management, they fail to attain the ultimate goal. If the sociability of the children and the enjoyment of play implements, etc., depends upon constant direction of teachers or leaders, if plays and games depend for their successful termination upon “umpiring” of instructors, if our present school methods of constant marshalling prevail on the playground, yes, even if the behavior of younger children is constantly controlled by older children, we have simply a modification of a police force.

Play is a teacher’s principal means of reaching the whole child. It helps the child by counteracting the evil effects of sedentary occupations, it fosters character and civic virtue, it develops the motor-brain, makes intellectual training easier and the whole school life more attractive, and last, but not least, it makes the teacher more attractive to the children, becoming as much a boon to the one as to the other.

We are more than ever learning that education for service demands on the part of the teacher a knowledge of the whole child and not a knowledge of his capacity for academic training alone. How are we going to know about the “wrinkles” in a child’s character and how can we. find out the “queer” habits he may be developing^ unless we give him a chance to expose them? It is a teacher’s business to iron out the wrinkles and to train away the queer habits.

We quite agree with Mr. George Wittich of Milwaukee about the conduct of exhibitions. They are only valuable on Playgrounds and in Municipal Gymnasiums if they are demonstrations of the regular work which has been carried on. Almost all playground systems close their seasons with a Field-day, and the temptation to make a brave showing has led many directors to “work up” for an exhibition during the last few weeks. Playground activities, to have real educational value, should lead towards the formation of good habits of rational recreation. Forced or artificial “get-ups” are not rational.

We have just received the program of the Classes for Recreation Workers which are to be conducted in Richmond, Va., April 29th to May 6th under the auspices of the Playground and Recreation Association of America. It is understood that this school.is primarily conducted for the benefit of “recreation-secretaries, those having charge of the recreation system of a city.” The invitation to attend this school is alsp extended to supervisors and play leaders. There are to be forty-three hours devoted to various phases of recreation departments. The program is broad and it ought to develop among those attending a more comprehensive point of view of playground possibilities. We are sorry that no special attention is# given to recreation problems of the workers.

“Enhancing the Efficiency of Our Working Youths” is the title of a very exhaustive address by Prof. Kaup, M. D., before the XIII German Congress fuer Yolks und Jugendspiele. With this address he gives carefully compiled comparative statistics of German and English occupations and the comparative health and efficiency of rural and city workers. By the help of these statistics which were gathered from authoritive sources, he proves that there is today a very much greater need than formerly for training along physical lines of children of school age and below school age. He lays the causes for the rapid decline of the health of our working youth to these new factors: Lack of recreation space for children below school age and of school age; injudicious choice of profession; too ldng working hours; employment of youth in unhealthy places; the unhealthy arrangement of continuation schools during evening hours; unfavorable housing and feeding; unhealthy sleeping quarters; misuse of tobacco and alcohol; lack of gymnasiums and playgrounds, irrational employment of Sunday leisure and insufficient vacations.

Mr. Christian Eberhard deserves much credit as General Floor Manager of the Gymnastic Demonstration arranged by the Municipal Athletic Association of Boston, on the evening of March 8th. It waa a very long program and required a good general to carry it out on time.

The Boston Park- Bath- Gymnasium and Music Departments are now combined under one head as the City of Boston Recreation Department. A commission of three men is at the head of the new Department. The chairman receives a salary of $7500. The other two*

members are unpaid. It is contemplated to, appoint two sub-commissioners, each at a salary of $4200. One of these will be Superintendent of Parks and the other Superintendent of, Recreation.

The time is rapidly approaching' when we can no more resist the reasonableness of the public's demand for the extended use of school buildings. With this, we should, however, recognize that rational playground development demands the enlargement and development of the • schoolyards'. This is* imperative if we are to meet the needs of the children below school age, 2—6, and the primary grade children. These children’s corners to be useful and effective must be close to the people’s homes. Our school buildings are already centrally located. No school building should be erected unless six square yards of play space for evety child in the building is provided for. The school building of the future must have at least this space. The basement and the first floor will be devoted to gymnasiums, baths and play club rooms, etc., and the school rooms will be on the second and third floors. The yard will contain all kinds of equipment and facilities for children from 2—9 years. Such a school plant will be used in the evening for a social centre for workers, young and old. If we had such school buildings there would be less objections by the school authorities. As it is we cannot blame the masters who are responsible for the schooling. But there is no reason why we should have so much objection from school people. It is unreasonable, to suppose that our municipalities could provide sufficient sanitaries, shelters, store rooms, etc., to meet the needs of our children when at play. In most places the trouble comes from divided authority and the lack of thorough understanding of the value of recreation.

SCHOOL SOCIAL CENTRES.

(From the Journal of Social and Civic, Chicago.)

Three hundred and thirty-eight schools in 101 cities of the United States were used as social centres during the past season, according to a report compiled by Clarence Arthur Perry for the Sage Foundation. Officials of the United States Bureau of Education, who have examined the report, declare that it is bound to stimulate interest in this rapidly developing phase of the movement for wider use of the school plant.

Mr. Perry finds that in 44 of the 101 cities social centres were directed by paid workers. New York had 48 such centres and Chicago 16, while Philadelphia, Boston, Columbus, Detroit, Jersey City, Louisville, Rochester and Trenton are also among the cities included in this list. There is wide variation in the length of the season, from five or six weeks in some localities to the full school term in others. In fact, little uniformity prevails as to what, constitutes a social centre. Mr. Perry presents in the report a tentative definition of a social centre as follows:	A	community may be said to have .a schoolhouse social

centre if one of its school buildings is thrown open to the public on one or more fixed nights a week for at least 12 weeks a year, for activities of a social, recreational, or civic character, regularly directed bv one or more trained leaders.”

The report also presents data on the growing use of school buildings for political meetings. In Cleveland, Ohio, meetings were held in the school to discuss the new constitutional provisions that were before the people for adoption. In Jersey City the public schools were opened to partisan political meetings with gratifying results; eight public school auditoriums in New York City were also opened for the same purpose, and in Chicago the assembly halls were employed for political rallies and proved a distinctly popular innovation. Milwaukee, Wis., and Worcester, Mass., are cities where the schools have for some time been used for political meeting places.	*

The use of schools as polling places is another recent development. Thirty schools in Los Angeles were used for this purpose in 1911. In the past year Milwaukee began using the basement of school buildings as polling places. In New York the commissioner of accounts'recommended that the school buildings be used for registration booths throughout the city, declaring that the plan would mean the saving of considerable part of the hundred thousand dollars expended for rental every year. Definite adoption of the idea of schools as polling places is reported from Boston, Mass., Berkeley and Long Beach Calif., Grand Rapids, Midi., Madison, Wis., and Salt Lake City, Utah.

It is always refreshing to see how organized co-operation will accomplish results. The Program of the Sixth Annual Field Day of the Philadelphia Public Schools," May 24th is in itself a comprehensive document. Part I, Mass Exercises; Part II, Track and Field Events; Part III, Games, including (a) Dodsre Ball, $nd (b) Captain Ball; Part IV, Exhibition Work.

PROGRAM.

REGULATIONS -PART I : MASS EXERCISE.

The schools will assemble at 4 o’clock in the column, of which they will be advised at the south end of the plateau in closed ranks of fours, all the taller ones on the right. At the command, they will march up the field

PART II : FIELD AND TRACK EVENTS.

This is a group contest. A school may enter four teams, boys’ junior and senior, and girls’ junior and senior, each consisting of 16 members. Each team must compete in all three events of this group to be described below. The team results for all three events will be counted in making the awards.

1.	Standing Broad Jump.. Each team shall consist of 16 members. Each one is allowed two jumps, the best to count. Each competitor must take his two jumps in succession. At the conclusion of each team’s jumping, the best jump made by each pupil on that team shall be counted and the total result recorded.

2.	Basket Ball Far Throw. Each team shall consist of 16 members. Each one is allowed two throws. The ball must weigh not less than 18 nor more than 21 ounces. It shall be thrown with both hands, over the head, standing behind a line known as the scratch line, and the best throw will count. Credit will be given for whole feet only.

3.	Shuttle Relay Race. Sixteen to a team. Eight runners of »

Hteam shall be arranged behind a post at one end of the lane and the-remaining eight behind a post at the other end. Several teams will run at the same time.

PART III: GAMES.

(a)	Dodge Ball. Open to boys and girls of the 5th and 6th grades. The classification allows a school to enter 4 Dodge Ball Teams, boysr junior and senior and girls* junior and senior. The game will be governed by 1911 rules.

(b) Captain Ball. Open to boys and girls of the 7th and 8th grades. Four teams likewise may represent a school, though it is to be remembered that the dividing height of juniors and seniors in this-event is 5 feet 3 inches. This game will also be governed by 1911 rules.

In these games schools compete in one division. A school is eliminated after losing two games. A team will play not more than four games and for each game won will be credited one point.

It is possible for a school to enter eight teams. Snould each team win every game that school would receive 32 points.

PART IV: EXHIBITION WORK.

This is open to girls of grammar grades. It will consist of three-school dances, “The Elf s’ Frolic,” “Children’s Quickstep” and “Jolly Crowd,” performed by all schools at the same time.

Girard College, Philadelphia, is planning a system of most elaborate Playgrounds, 4 in all, Mr. John Nolen, Landscape Architect and City Planner has been engaged as adviser, and the preliminary plans-nave been accepted.

COMBINATION RUNNING AND BOWLING GAME.

By ERNST HERMANN, West Newton, Mass.

#

This game has proved attractive to young children as well as to-College students and University Professors. Up to eight members are in each team and they are all kept busy throughout the race. Five-innings are sufficient during ordinary class work. Have score cards-lined out on the gymnasium floor, or provide small hand blackboards. The first runner in each team upon his return should be the scorer. Shorten the distance for younger children, and use medicine balls. For children and girls use one pound balls, and for older people use two-pound balls. Be sure to put the starting line at least six feet behind the pin line. A lane of from eight to ten feet width for each team is quite sufficient.

Those who are to give this game a trial are advised to buy regulation American candlepins, and to have two inches of one end painted blue and the other red. We advise this because we will describe a number of good races for which such candlepins come in handy. Otherwise, use Indian Clubs.

SCORING FOR EACH HEAT*

Bowling down one pin, five points; two pins, ten points; three pins,, a strike, twenty points for the player. The pins must always be set

NOTE.—Members of each team who are not actually running must set up the fallen pins, but they must be behind the starting line by the time the ball reaches the pins. The next to run must look out for the ball, gather it up quickly and do his turn.

J. LEONARD MASON, City Hall, Newark, N. J.

NEWARK PLAYGROUND.

Steps looking toward the establishment of a municipal athletic association were recently taken by the Newark, N. J. Playground Commission.

The Director of Recreation was given power to act and to send out a general call to individuals and organizations interested in the work contemplated. This will read as follows:

“In order to encourage interest in athletic sports among our citizens, and for the purpose of developing the work of the department in the broadest and most comprehensive manner, the*,commission had deemed it advisable to approve of the formation of an athletic association, public in character, and embracing all reasonable forms of physical activity.

“It is necessary that work of this nature be done through the instrumentality of an organization which will be recognized and accepted as a responsible body by those persons and committees who prescribe and regulate the laws and customs which govern athletic contests throughout the world.

“To this end, therefore, it was seemed proper to organize the Municipal Athletic Association of Newark as a public institution established with the co-operation of all citizens and organizations interested and to employ this association as a means by which vto stimulate a more general interest in physical exercise, training and education in the city.”

AT LONDON, MARCH 13.

The dark blue of Oxford flashed across the finish line at Mortlake, three-quarters of a length ahead of the light blue of Cambridge, in one of the most spectacular races that have ever taken place in the annual “battle of the blues,” which was fought out over the Thames course for the seventieth time today. The time for the four and a quarter miles from Putney to the finish was 20 minutes 53 seconds, which is more than two minutes slower than the record of 18:29, made by Oxford . in 1911.

This makes five wins in succession for Oxford and a total of thirty-nine victories to thirty for Cambridge, the race in 1877 resulting in a dead heat.

WORLD’S RECORDS AT A. A. U. GAMES.

Record-breaking performances marked the annual National indoor championship games of the Amateur Athletic Union held recently at Madison Square Garden, New York. Olympic, international, National, and intercollegiate champions competed in nearly every one of the thirteen events on the programme, which was run off with commendable promptitude.

BOSTON DEMONSTRATION.

A gymnastic demonstration was given in the South Armory, Irving 6treet, under the auspices of the Municipal Athletic Association of the city of Boston. About 1000 gymnasts and athletes took part in the entertainment, which was by far the largest event of its kind ever seen in this city. Representatives from almost every athletic organization in Boston participated.

The program opened with a grand march of aril the contestants and an exhibition of school gymnastics. Folk dancing by the pupils of the Abraham Lincoln school was the next event. The music for this number was rendered by the Abraham Lincoln school orchestra. About 75 girls from the girls’ high school went through some free standing exercises and marching.

The best received event was the exhibition of calisthenics, with floor exercises, dancing, steel wand drill and Highland fling by the Boston municipal gymnasiums. There were classes from eight of the city gymnasiums, over 200 men taking part.

The Boston Athletic Association members exercised with stuffed and inflated balls, the Roxbury Turn Verein did club swinging to music, a camp fire feature was given by the Boy Scouts and the Volkmann school did tumbling and pyramid work.

The general apparatus work by representatives of various gymnasiums afforded a beautiful sight. There were exercises on horizontal bars, parallel bars, horse, hand-balancing, ground tumbling, pyramids, wrestling and Swedish box.

After a short speech Mayor John F. Fitzgerald presented trophies to the winners of the Municipal A. A. various outdoor events, and the entertainment closed with an exhibition of wall scaling by the 1st company of the Coast Artillery Corps and a color ceremony by a detail from the Coast Artillery and the Boy Scouts.

Physiology and Hygiene.

By D. M. FEED. KEOGH, M. D.. Cleveland School, Newark, N. J.

—Neurasthenia and Obesity.—The characteristic medley of symptoms, psychic and physical, exhibited by the neurasthenic has long been a fruitful field for study by clinicians, and there must be very few phenomena associated with the disease that have not, at some time or other, been observed and placed on record. The due recognition of the fact that in neurasthenia an actual inhibition of the various secretory mechanisms of the body may occur has modified, to a certain extent, former conceptions of the malady, as also the part now known to be played in the etiology of many of its symptoms by toxic absorption. One aspect has not received the attention, perhaps, that its importance deserves—namely, the relationship of obesity to the neurasthenic state, for many neuropaths are the reverse of being emaciated -and an undue corpulence is not infrequently followed by neurasthenia. Drs. L. J. Llewellyn and D. Lloyd Smith, of Llandrindod Wells, have recently called attention to the connection between the two morbid states, and in their opinion The obese neurasthenic requires the greatest care when undergoing reduction cures. They also conclude that the prognosis is better in patients who are slightly emaciated, for if a neurasthenic is afflicted with “embonpoint,” as Esquirol pointed out, trouble may be expected. The possibility of latent tuberculosis in the obese has further to be borne in mind in the examination and treatment of cases of this type of neurasthenia.—Medical Press and Circular.

Old-Fashioned Morality and Health.—A clean mind in a clean body: the ideal is as old as the Stoics. But it is as modern as it is ancient, and to-day it is the essence of sanitation, of social morality, of eugenics. He who follows the prosaic directions of common old-fashioned morality is already far advanced in the science of health.—

-^—Inhalation of Dust, and Tuberculosis of the Lungs.—On exposing normal guinea-pigs to the inhalation of various kinds of dust Cesa Bianchi found that more or less inflammation of the bronchial mucous membrane and enlargement of the peribronchial lymph-nodes would result, but that otherwise the conditions in the exposed were quite like those in normal animals. When guinea-pigs exposed to dust were infected with tubercle bacilli, however, they almost without exception perished from tuberculosis, the process running a much more rapid course, and the pulmonary involvement being much more pronounced in the exposed animals than in the control animals. The results did not seem to be modified by different kinds of dust. There developed in some of the animals an extensive cavity formation in'various parts of the lungs, especially those in which the tubercle bacilli were introduced through the air passages. It appears then that inhalation of dust in the guinea-pig reduces the resistance of the lung tissue to tubercle bacilli so that it becomes a more favorable soil for their de-

velopment. " It is well known that in normal guinea-pigs it is difficult to produce a tuberculosis which is predominatingly localized in the lungs; in animals exposed to dust, however, this seems to take place readily, especially when the infection is introduced by way of the respiratory passages. These results corroborate the results of clinical experience and statistical study to the effect that the inhalation of dust of various kinds is harmful and favors directly the development of pulmonary tuberculosis.—Journ. Am. Med. Assoc.

—Treatment of Obesity.—Dr. A.; Galisch reports in the Med. Klinick, Berlin, Xov. 1912, that he has been very successful in reducing the weigh*t of his over corpulent patients by the one simple .measure of reducing the amount of food taken after midday, thus giving the body less nourishment at night to build fat out of. The patient eats until satisfied at breakfast and noonday dinner, but after this takes only a little coffee or tea and one small sandwich for tea and supper. Exercise and work during the afternoon provide for utilization of the food taken up to noon. All his patients lost one or two pounds a week * on this restriction of food a|ter the noon meal, and all thrived on it.

—Competitive Athletics.—Under the American system of making specialists out of a few individuals, the primary idea of exercise would seem to tend to the creation of a desire on the part of a few to excel in doing feats of skill and# strength, and to the many a desire to view such displays; the rounding out, uniform, and healthful development ot all individuals being a secondary instead of a primary consideration. It follows that for many individuals there is created no actual liking for exercise, these persons never having really felt the well-being that comes from a proper dosage, exercise for the athletes having been made a drudgery in ojder to obtain excellence in condition and teamwork, all pleasurable sensations being lost in the lust for conquest. The athletes, therefore, unless they make their living thereby, soon give up their methods of obtaining exercise because of dislike, or inability to gather others together for a contest, or from, lack of a field of play, while the non-athletes, having learned no other form of athletic pleasure than that of viewing others perform, go the way of the ignorant.—Murphy in the U. S. Xav. Med. Bull.

—The Value of Experimental Physiology to the Community.—The science which they (the physiologists) teach is the science of life, from which is eliminated all sordid and selfish considerations. A scientist in his laboratory discovers a great truth, which saves the lives of thousands of human beings. The doctor engaged in everyday practice makes use of that knowledge to preserve, perhaps, the life of your child. Give him any praise you think fit, but don’t entirely forget the physiologist who taught him the art.—F. M. Sandwith, Clin. Jour.

a very moderate amount of the plainest and most nourishing food thoroughly fletcherized, and (3) plenty of outdoor activity and a moderate amount of full breathing exercises, and (4) plenty of pure water, to be drunk the first thing in the morning, the last thing at night, and between meals.—Nautilus.

—Tropical Residences and Copious Water-Drinking.—The late Dr. Paul C. Freer, in a study of the effects of tropical sunlight (Philippine Journal of Science), arrived at two interesting conclusions concerning residence in the tropics and the use of water by soldiers on the march. He believed that in a climate like that of the Philippines, with the sea modifying the extremes of temperature, and with a large proportion of cloudy weather, the man, by taking proper precautions, should not find it deleterious, and need only seek the shade to avoid danger from even the greatest insolation. Soldiers on the march or other persons compelled to spend much time in the sunlight should wear white underclothing and helmets and should be supplied with an abundance of safe water, the two canteens allowed the soldiers not being sufficient, in Freer’s opinion, to maintain a proper equilibrium of body fluids, allowing sufficient perspiration to carry away the excess of body heat. Likewise copious water-drinking in any country in hot weather, with free perspiration, tends to reduce discomfort from excessive heat. The vice of iced drinks is that they are too cold to be taken into the stomach in large enough quantities for free and cooling perspiration, and their coldness defeats the very purpose for which they are taken—to cool the body.	  »

—Defective School Children.—In America, today, there are, says Hearst’s Magazine twenty million children attending our public schools.

Dr. Thomas D. Wood, Professor of Physical Education in the Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, says that seventy-five per cent, of these children—that is, fifteen million of them—need attention for physical defects.

Carrying with them these defects, they are handicapped in the great game of Life.

There is a great loss in educating defectives. The only object of education, anyway, is to give us a better citizenship.

The old law of “in corpore sano” certainly applies.

We owe it to the rising generation to relieve them as much as possible from every physical disadvantage.

Education is supposed to give weapons with which we fight life’s battles.

A very valuable booklet by Dr. Wood has-been printed by the United States Bureau of Education. A copy of this can be secured by wrriting to the Bureau at Washington.

In this booklet will be found a very frank, but good-humored discussion of the subject of physical defects in children.

As long as the youngster does not actually get sick or die, we assume that he is well, “But the fact is,” says Dr. Wood, “that five per cent, of children have a tendency toward tuberculosis, and the disease is easily evolved in them.

— 87 —

Five per cent, have curvature of the spine.

Five per cent, have defective hearing.

Twenty-five per cent, have defective vision.

Twenty-five per cent, are suffering from malnutrition.

Thirty per cent, have enlarged tonsils or adenoids.

From fifty to ninety-eight per cent, of all children in our public schools have defective teeth, which interferes with health and, therefore, with their thinking processes.

The loss to the world through physical inefficiency is absolutely incomputable. The necessity of supervision and the tremendous'cost involved comes largely from the fact that we are not good animals?”

It is good to see that Dr. Wood is not inclined to think that we need drugs or medicine, but what we need is knowledge and an ability to put ourselves in line with the great forces of Nature that make for health, happiness and efficiency.—From “Hygiene and the Child.”

4 —Living Too Fast.—Fast living, in the sense of such living as shortens life, is a much more common evil than is generally supposed, and we believe that in the case of a very great number of persons the rapidity of pulse is above the normal average. Every man’s life may be measured by pulse-beats. He will live, accident excepted, to make a definite number of these, and his life will be shortened in proportion to the excess of work performed by his vital organs in a given time. Excitement, physical or mental, is the cause of the rapid rate at which such people are living. The love of excitement is a vice, as possibly evil in itself as love of strong drink, or gambling, or licentiousness. It matters not what kind of excitement, all excitement* is fast living, and begets a feeling of exhaustion in intervals of indulgence which clamor for relief from some other form of stimulant. Tims it is that the universal demand-for artificial stimulants has increased until there is, perhaps, not one in a hundred who does not resort to something of this kind. Alcohol, absinthe, opium, hashish, tobacco, coffee, tea, or whatever it may be, is taken to support the system under the effect of nervous prostration, and supply in another form^ the excitement it craves. Now, all this is exactly the reverse of what should be the case. Instead of seeking excitement, health and long life demand that we should shun it. The natural condition of the body is that of unruffled calmness. If excitement occur it should be exceptional, not the rule of life.—“Health,” London.

—Beware of Colds.—Take care not to take cold, for these colds, simple though they may seem, are not to be trifled with. It may be a little troublesome to put on gaiters, over shoes, and all the rest of the paraphernalia on going out for a short distance in wet weather, but it is far easier to prevent pneumonia, catarrh, neuralgia, consumption, and the kindred disorders arising from colds than to cure them. In a slight cold lurk the seeds of numberless fatalities. Avoid taking cold by using a little common sense, and the needed precautions against exposure to dampness and change of temperature. Begin at the feet. See that they are properly dressed for the season and then see that they are kept

warm. Make the clothing of the body largely of flannel, wearing it next to the skin. Don't be afraid of the air, and take vigorous and abundant exercise.—'“Health,” London.

—The Nourishing Parts of Eggs.—In many recent works on medicine it is recommended to give patients yolks of eggs to keep up their nourishment, but a little knowledge of physiological chemistry will show that it is a mistake to give the yolk preference over the white. The nitrogenous parts of the egg contents are albumen and globulin, both easily digested and assimilated. The fatty substance which predominates in the yolk is mainly lecithin. This fat, while undergoing digestion, is partially converted into a poisonous product called choline, which under certain conditions may become absorbed and give rise to biliousness. The authority to whom we have referred has repeatedly found that a patient made “bilious” by one whole egg can take a dozen raw whites daily without discomfort, and greatly to his advantage. An excellent way to take them is to add a little salt, red pepper, and lemon-juice to three whites in a glass, but these condiments are not always necessary. Infants will often do well on them when dissolved (not beaten) in water, and a little sugar added. It should be remembered, however, that the egg globulin does not dissolve in the water, but is precipitated, and should be separated by straining. If a weakly person on waking takes two whites of eggs, his appetite on going down to breakfast is greatly benefited.—“Health,” London.
