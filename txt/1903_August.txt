THE INFLUENCE OF GYMNASTICS ON MIND AND BODY.

By ERNEST WUESTHOFF.

THE question of physical education is one which is attracting wide attention among modern civilized nations. Gymnastics, as is now generally acknowledged, rests not only on a physical but also on a moral and mental necessity as much as does the common school itself.

Unfortunately there is a drawback to all instruction given in the school-room. No sooner is a-child sent/to school, than his cheerfulness is being repressed, and it begins to show a physical and mental lassitude that makes it obey every command but mechanically. When the child grows to be a young man or woman and begins to relish the pleasure of study, we usually find again that the thing is being overdone; ambition and knowledge incite to new labors whereas nature demands rest and recreation. And nature can never be abused with impunity. The student often grows indifferent to the world. From the school-room he returns to his study to burden his memory with more matter, and day by day becomes duller of comprehension. In trying to overcome this dullness he increases his exertions; and the result is that our high schools and universities are producing armies of —mere book-worms.

to play with his companions and opens all the perceptive avenues of his mind to observe, absorb, imitate and reproduce in action what he sees, hears, and is surrounded by. All other thoughts and advice are forgotten or put aside by his play. All these influences, in return, shape the forces of his life into habits or tendencies of conduct and manners of living which manifest themselves through what we call character. For the sake of the child’s character the greatest attention should be turned to the child’s play. It is on the playground that educators must look for a very large portion of what they have been so diligently seeking in the schoolroom.,’

“Playgrounds are important educational factors. They stimulate and guide life in a way nothing else can do. Their relation to the development of character is very similar to that which the school bears toward the development of the mind. In fact the collective play of children has a greater influence in forming habits of personal, social conduct of life, than has school or even home instruction and advice. Many practical questions for solution of which we have been looking to the school and church will be found to belong to the playground to solve.’* “The playground will make useful the wide waste of idle time which neither the church, home nor school controls. Education falls short of its true scope as long as it does not lift the environment of the child in its hours of relaxation, does not teach it how to live morally, until it becomes in fact to the people a school of applied ethics.”

In Chicago a federation of 61 women’s clubs looked over the field and went to work three years ago. Their committee voiced the sentiments, ideas and ideals underlying the movement, as following:

“With the close of the school year begins the period of danger to the morals and health of the children of the poor. The children of the well-to-do have every provision made to guard and occupy them during vacation. The children of the poor are without legitimate pastime or playthings beyond the garbage box and the exitement of the patrol wagon and various street evils. Their homes in the stifling tenements are too crowded, and the parks too distant for them to use. The are forced upon the hot and dirty streets which to many become a school for crime.”

“An investigation of a typical district justifies the statement, since the police records show an increase of 60 per cent in juvenile arrests in the summer months. The enforced idleness demoralizes and degrades our growing citizens and is a menace to our city. The cost in money

and morals is so great that every taxpayer must see the economy of establishing such institutions as prevent this demoralization.”

“The vacation school meets the evils of these conditions and overcomes them. It is in no sense a continuation of the work of the school year. Xo text books are used. All attendance is voluntary. An adjunct of the school is the playground.”

The labor unions, composed of men who are in a measure practical social philosophers, have endorsed the plan of public playgrounds as being directly beneficial to poor people, supplementing their efforts to give their children enjoyment and healthful recreation. In cities where * e plan has been tried it has been backed solidly by organized labor.
-157-

Mayor Jones, the Golden Rule man of Toledo—you have heard of him—is the president of the Complete Education League ol that city. In a public address he said: “I am fully in sympathy with this idea of the new education. It is not of necessity a complex idea. The playground and equipment may be simple in its nature—a sand-pile affords an unending fund of entertainment for little children. A few bricks or large building blocks furnish entertainment for older minds. Then come swings, may-poles, football, etc., the object being to keep the children’s minds healthfully and naturally employed, and to guide the children to so live that they will go to their educational work just as freely and gladly as they now go to their play.”

A committee appointed by the Chicago city council to devise plans for small parks and playgrounds reported that they found the conditions in wards where no playgrounds surrounded the schools to be a source of corruption to the young. To quote: “Schools and open-air playgrounds in any enlightened scheme of education should go hand in hand. We strenuously urge upon city council and board of education the adoption of this rule, to be adhered to without exception, that hereafter no elementary school house shall be erected without an open-air playground attached thereto and used in connection with the same, to be always maintained as a playground. After school hours the grounds fitted with apparatus should be thrown open to the neighborhood.” In crowded districts it is also recommended that the roofs of school houses be utilized as in New York city.

At the opening of a playground in Buffalo, Alderman Avery said: “Exclude children from God’s sunlight and pure air, and }rou will add a ruined constitution to the evil of a dulled mind. When this country was young, the people were strong physically because their labor was out-of-doors in the country. But this is the age of large cities, and opportunities for physical development are limited. For this reason this playground has been built.”

The mayor of Boston at the time public playgrounds and vacation schools were organized in his city to keep the youth under some sort of supervision made an address, in which he said:	“In	my	opinion the

economic, social and moral loss of leaving the great mass of children, upon whose education such an amount of money has been expended, to run wild to a great extent during the summer months, is so great that the community cannot longer afford to let it continue. If even two per cent of the expense of carrying on the public schools was devoted to some form of vacation training, I have no doubt that it would be a more profitable and economic expenditure of public money.”

This sub-head bids fair to run into a volume. The thoughts and theories are so many, the side-lights so numerous and the testimony so great that it has run away with more than its share of the evening’s time.

WHAT A PLAYGROUND IS.

The playground, of which the need has been so strenuously claimed, is both ideal and practical.

Tsanoff tells us of the ideal and describes it as containing two
-160-

ber of arrests in the slum precincts of New York city following upon the opening of the public playgrounds. He told us also of the change of front on the part of the youth in one rough district. At first the appliances were destroyed and the attendants routed. Later when the funds ran out and the ground was to be closed on that account children to the number of 180 brought money to keep things moving.

The superintendent of the public playground in Toledo said : “Since the establishment of the playground, the children are better, brighter and stronger. Visits of the patrol wagon are not so frequent. The windows are not broken. Serious mischief has ceased."

Police Commissioner John B. Merrill, of the same city had a similar bit of testimony*:	“I	have	found the wholesale falling off in arrests in

the Canton Avenue district is due to the installation of the kindergarten and playground in that locality. I have found that in man3’ instances the children learn some new game, some moral lesson, some lesson in unselfishness, and bear it from the playground into the family. Little do we know how many lives and hearts have stirred to new thoughts and new feelings by the lessons learned and examples derived from that one little playground in the short 3'ear it has been established.”

In Buffalo, where a school playground has been fitted up for vacation use at an expense of $50, the daily attendance averaged 500. A policeman said : “One person can take care of them while they are there, whereas it would take eight or ten policemen to see to them on the street."

In Chicago various causes worked against a general attendance at the public playgrounds. The first was a feeling of exclusiveness; second, the seeming necessity for child-labor in factories and elsewhere; third, the smallness of the yards. To explain the last reason, the summer the report was made, over 200 children daily tried to play in a dusty court 60x100 feet. The Chicago committee also found that children of differ-ing ages have nothing in common so far as amusement is concerned. Where the ground is small, reccommendation is made that special hours be assigned for different ages—perhaps from 8 a. m. till noon for the youngest children, from 1 o’clock until 6 p. m. for older ones and from 7 o’clock till 10 p. m. for the older boys and girls. This committee also found that unsupervised yards are quickly demoralized and have a demoralizing influence.

In Chicago, the tough boy furnished a problem. Theoretically he should be welcomed, interested, retained and humanized. In man3' instances in practice it was found expedient to escort him to the entrance and point his toes down the street. The civilizing influence had entered his life too late, and exclusion was the onty possible policy. The older and rougher boys sometimes terrorized the children and defeated the purpose of the ground. In addition to his characteristic attitude as a menace to society the hoodlum has another characteristic —that of malevolence toward his kind. During his growth he has been deprived of all chance for healthful, joyous play. The play instinct seems later to turn into malignancy and cruelty toward his fellows. The pitiful element of the older street arab’s life is his inability to enjoy himself.

A. W. O’Neill, secretary of the Chicago special park commission, ha9 a fine summing-up in his report: “It seems to me an indisputable fact that the school boards in all the large cities should make provisions for the playground education of boys and girl9, out of doors, during and after school hours, winter and summer, with the same thoroughness and system that prevails in the class room work.”

“These playgrounds, liberally supplied with apparatus, swings, sand courts, shelters, benches, kindergarten tents and shade trees, controlled by well-qualified supervisors and gymnastic instructors, are absolutely necessary to child development and to save our boys and girls from the evil influences of the street, the debasing theaters and dance-halls, the saloons and cigarette shops. The class-room influence of the teacher is quickly dissipated when the boy is turned out into the street to do as he pleases.”

“It is vital to the success of these playgrounds that the supervision and direction should be in skilled hands. These trained leaders should guide the children’s play, and the least possible amount of restriction be practiced. The physical activities should be blended with the qualities of heart and mind—character building, kindness, unselfishness, consideration for others and disipline, all along lines of natural development. By such means the class-room work of the teacher will be lightened greatly and the playground be voted an inestimable blessing.”

JUST TO CLOSE WITH.

In spite of the fact that we have all been children, and in spite of all our laboratories for child study, no one knows the child mind. We all knew once and we have forgotten. It is a pity we have forgotten. Such forgetfulness leaves the child’s right’s unrecognized ii> municipal plans. It leaves him unrepresented on school board, city council and board of park commissioners. Everything is done for his good that grown-up care and kindness and wisdom can suggest, and yet there is a lack. Believing that a child is near to nature and therefore not far wrong in his efforts toward the growth of his individality, our inability to understand him alone prevents our wisely planning for his welfare. A child’s natural tendencies do not lack simplicity, but when his nature is thwarted by the authority of the stronger, he will develop such complex wants that the grown-up who has taken upon himself to amuse, teach and culture him is at his wit’s end for device; and plan and theory. It is well to let the child grow as nature points, and that is largely through play. And he ought to be given the chance. Please allow the interpolation of one more sliver of Jacob Riis’ common sense: “To play in the sunlight is a child’s right, and it is not to be cheated of it. And when it is cheated of it, it is not the child but the community that is robbed of that besides which all its wealth is but tinsel and thrash. For men, not money, make a country great, and joyless children do not make good men.”

You gentlemen of the Contemporary Club are interested in the children of the world at large, but more deeply are you interested in the children of our home—Davenport. It is well for us and our neighbors to consider provisions to be made against the city’s growth, for coming
-162-

generations of Davenport children.- The need will grow with density of population. The calamity by fire of last July should be turned into a municipal blessing by the laying out of a playground in the burned-over district adjacent to the river with its greatest feature, a public natatorium. There should be a public playground on the hills in the eastern part of the city, one at Central Park, one in Park Lawn, one in Hamburg, another at West end. Lafayette square or Washington square should be divested ol landscape gardening and turned over to the children and youth. Sites purchased by the school board in accordance with the policy so sensibly inaugurated should be utilized as playgrounds from the date of their purchase and in perpetuo. It will cost, but it will be a purchase on a magnificent scale of health and happiness, manhood and womanhood for Twentieth Century Davenport.

Miss Sadie American, one of Chicago’s leaders in the playground movement, closed an article in the American Journal of Sociology thus: ‘ The child is father of the man, and the street is no place or refuge for one or the other in his leisure moments. May the wise see to it that resorts for upbuilding recreation insure such occupation of leisure hours as shall be indeed a re-creation for body and spirit, and give us a generation strong and joyous and fortified to resist and repel with a happy laugh every deteriorating temptation and tendency.”

Gentlemen, I thank you for your consideration and attention.

BRIEFS ON PHYSICAL TRAINING.

G.	Frank Lydston (American Medicine, Feb. 21 to March 21, 1903, inclusive) makes a plea for the better understanding and general practice of physical training by the medical profession. The system of movements which he believes to be the nearest ideal are those in which flexors are moved against resistance of extensors and vice versa. Enough of his conclusions are given here to make a comparative!y exhaustive abstract.

1.	The end and aim of physical training should be to utilize the inherent physical capital of the individual and develop it to its normal physiologic standard. The individual equation is the keynote of physical training. One should strive to develop and make ready to his command such muscular fiber as normally belongs to the individual subject.

2.	A general adoption of physiologic muscle building would cause a marked improvement in the physical strength, endurance and beauty of the race. Model physiques are much rarer than they should be.

3.	Physical and intellectual development, should go hand in hand. Neither should be perfected at the expense of the other. The harmonious development of mind and muscle is the most important factor in human society.

4.	A more thorough understanding and more general practice of physical training would tend to reduce pauperism and crime, and would materially decrease the expense of our ponderous legal machinery and penal system.

5.	Estimating the developmental necessities and capacity of a given individual by comparative measurements is often fallacious. The idea that an individual of a given height and weight should present definite proportional measurements of the various portions of the body is absurd.

6.	The inherent capacity for muscular development possessed by certain individuals is extreme. The muscular development of a Sandow, under precisely similar conditions, is possible only to Sandow and exceptional individuals of his type.

-163—

7. Specialism in muscle building is justifiable only in so far as it tends to bring up any given portion of the body to the relative proportions normal to the particular individual, i. e , to the normal symmetry.

8.	In beginning the training of adults the occupation should be considered. The muscles of the highly-trained athlete are out of place, useless and perhaps injurious to the man whose occupation is sedentary. Unused muscular fiber and visceral capacity result in muscular and visceral degeneration.

9.	Certain individuals tend to become muscle and joint bound under very moderate exercise, and a great care should be taken in prescribing physical training for them.

10.	The systematic practice of athletics, when carried to extremes, is likely to develop the athletic habit, i. e., a condition of the body in which cessation of training produces serious impairment of health. Under such circumstances the individual is a slave to training.

11.	Athletic overstrain is frequent and occurs in two forms—acute and chronic. Its evils are manifested, first, in individuals who are out of condition; second, in individuals, who, while in condition, undertake inordinate feats.

12.	Serious disturbances of the heart, lungs, kidneys and liver may result from overstrain, the heart, especially, being often damaged. Even appendicitis may be produced by athletic overstrain. Competitive athletics, as the term is ordinarily used, are especially dangerous in their effects upon the viscera.

13.	The average professional athlete at the age of 30 has exhausted his reserve fund of vitality, and should cease active training and athletic competition.

14.	Symmetric muscle building should be a preparation for practical athletics of all kinds. This muscle building should involve increase of volitional muscular control and a development of the muscles up to the individual normal standard, no attempt being, made to put large and bulky muscles upon individuals in whom such musries are not normal. The first lesson the subject should learn is the necessity of putting his brain-cell in absolute command of his muscle fiber.

15.	The ideal system of muscle building is that which involves the least expenditure of time and the use of the least apparatus.

16.	Abdominal muscle development is the keynote of success in physical training.

17.	Of practical athletics the best forms are boxing, fencing, and handball. All forms of athletics are most beneficial if practiced in the open air. Golf is admirable in this respect.

18.	The element of play should enter largely into all forms of athletics, diversion of mind and cheerful companionship being a sine qua non in obtaining the best results.

BOOK REVIEW.

( All the books mentioned under this head may be ordered from the Freidenker Publ. Co., Milwaukee.>

—‘‘The wise mother who is planning a summer-off for herself and children will bear in mind that occupation is as harmonizing a factor of daily life abroad as at home, and will take with her books and various other material which can be turned to account not only on rainy days, but during a part of each day. Absolute idleness bears, in my mind, the same relation to recreation that license does to liberty: one is bad, the other good; hence the children who have some slight task to perform throughout the summer vacation, derive more benefit from their vacation than those who are left wholly to their own devices.”

This paragraph is taken from a paper by Mrs. Theodore W. Bimey, in the August Delineator, which contains much helpful advice an the treatment of the child when away from home during the summer.

—A regular •‘shake-up” seems to have taken place in the Chicago turn societies since a great number of them have resolved on a change in their instructors.

PHYSICAL CULTURE DEPARTMENT AT ST. LOUIS WORLD S FAIR UNDER CONTROL OF SECRETARY OF A. A. U.

J. E. Sullivan, secretary of the A. A. U., has been appointed director of physical training for the World’s Fair and the following announcement outlines the scope of his work as well as the intentions of the authorities in this matter:

“Mr. J- B. Sullivan, secretary of the American Athletic Union, has been appointed chief of physical culture for the World’s Fair. Mr. Sullivan is a native of New York city and has been connected with American athletics for over a quarter of a century. He was for many years an active athlete himself. He is president of the Metropolitan Association of Athletic Unions of the United States and has been secretary of the American Athletic Union since the organization of that body. Besides being the recognized authority on records in this country, he has acted as referee at nearly all the important field meets and is the official referee for the Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association.

Mr. Sullivan has been in the city for the past few days and has held several conferences with the Expostion officials. Although it is announced that he has outlined a very elaborate program for 1904 nothing definite has been decided as to the number or time of the contests. This will be determined upon at a committee meeting of the American Athletic Union in this city August 10.

The World’s Fair management has appropriated $75,000 for prizes in all sports. It is suggested that the Olympic games last a week, and it is the intention of the Exposition to devote two days to the championship of the American Athletic Union. Other suggested features are a cross-country championship contest, three days of bicycling contests, quoits, national swimming contests of America, two weeks of tennis contests, two days of cricket, two days each for Gaelic and Association football, two days for an international hurdling match, three days of archery for men and women, two days for equestrian polo, and two for lacrosse.

The roque championship will be a feature, as will also basket-ball championships for schools, Y. M. C. A. clubs and college athletic clubs. Two days have been set aside for the Y. M. C. A. championships, and there will be a championship meeting, as well as separate days for contests among the German Turners of the United States. Three days will be assigned for the fencing championship of the world.

It is intended to have six days of automobiling. The management also hopes to complete arrangements with the North American Association of Amateur Oarsmen to bring to St. Louis the champion rowing clubs. For college football and baseball liberal appropriations have been made. The handicap college athletic meetings will be held in the early part of the year.”

As regards the program for athletic sports, there is hardly room for improvement in this announcement. No branch of sport is omitted, even the different nationalities in their respective favored exercise are considered.

Entered at the Milwaukee Post Office as Second Class Matter.

If Mr. Sullivan is responsible for these arrangements he certainly deserves congratulation of all lovers of games and sports.—But should athletics, as practiced in clubs and gymnasia, be the only feature of physical training represented at such an important occasion, whose prime object is illustration and education t

Some time ago we protested against the preliminary program as issued by the directors of the Fair, because it contained no provisions for educational and school gymnastics. Our protest was apparently of no avail since the more definite program as published above is as incomplete as was the former in this respect.

It may be that the authorities at St. Louis are not so much to blame as it looks at first sight, for it is rather unlikely that the respective committee contain any member, able to distinguish between athletics and school gymnastics.

Would it not have been the duty of societies like the A. A. A. P. E., or the North American Gymnastic Union to either individually or conjointly secure recognition for the educational part of physical education?

GAMES FOR SCHOOLS AND GYMNASIA. By W. C. SCHAEFER. Milwaukee, 1900. Freidenker Publishing Co. pp. 36; Bound half cloth. Price 60c.—The scarcity of text books on movement games for the girls and boys in our American public and private schools has long been felt as a grievous want. Of German books on the movement games there has never been a lack, but the English litterature was devoid of any acceptable collections of such games. Mr. Schaefer has undertaken the task to collaborate such a book with great insight and circumspection. The games are conspicuously arranged under different headings from sound pedagogical points of view and well classified for girls and boys. No teacher of our public, private, and gymnastic schools having Anglo-American pupils under his or her care can afford to be without this book. It embodies moral and physical as well as intellectual elements and is sure to attract the attention of every progressive pedagogue.

After the conclusion of the team competition, the closing of the order and retreat of the same was left to the direction of the respective physical directors.

Preliminary Remarks—The wand drill is composed of two groups, each consisting of two exercises and containing eight movements. The exercises are to be executed twice left and then twice right. Two beats (counts) for each movement, the execution on the first (or uneven numbered) count and hold the pos. during the second count.

During the mass exercises of all teams both groups were repeated in their order after a rest of 32 counts and all had turned left face, so that the audience seated at the 1. side could also appreciate the view as was the case in the original front.

The wand was carried at r. shoulder, resting on the r. forefinger, from which pos. the same was lowered to starting pos. including the salute, as follows :

a)	Grasp wand with 1. hand about the center of the same—1!

b)	Lower wand to vertical pos. oti 1. side (1. arm extended)—2!

c)	Raise r. arm sidew. r.—3!

Note—Shortly before the contest was begun, the judges chose by ballot, one of the two exercises on each apparatus; in addition each competitor executed an exercise of his own selection (one free for all). On the long horse only the obligatory exercise was executed, while the side-horse was chosen for the selected exercise (one free for all).

The competitors were permitted to execute the exercises 1. or r.

Added to the above apparatus work, were the broad-jump and 100 yards dash.

The points of each individual were added and divided by the number in each team to decide upon the result for the said team and consequent standing for a team prize.

Following the above contest, a grand gymnastic exhibition was given by the various teams before a large and enthusiastic audience on two parallel bars in combination with two side horses; three horizontal bars (side by side); calisthenic drill; flag drill by 24 ladies; wrestling positions, and as a final, a mass wand drill by all participants (160) as above described.

June 29th, the second day of the festival, was given up to fencing with the foils and sabre and wrestling in the various classes. In the afternoon a pentathlon consisting of the five athletic events as in the following order named:	*

1.	16 lb shot put, best result 23 feet 7 inches.

2.	Hop-step-jump, best result 45 leet 3 inches. (There were five of the 17

competitors who cleared between 40 and 45 feet.)

3.	Rapid climbing (20 feet), best result 7 2-5 seconds.

4.	Pole vault, best result 10 feet 9 inches.

5.	120 yds. high hurdles, best result 16 4-5 seconds.

Every competitor had to clear seven points to be eligible for the succeeding events.

The last event of the meet was a 400 yards relay race by three teams. Time, 46 seconds. The time for this event would have been better, but since the track was what is termed “dead”, and only long enough for a 120 yards dash, the result could not have been otherwise.

In conclusion the statement may be made that, owing to the lack of space and since naming individual visitors can only interest the latter, reference to any of them is omitted.
