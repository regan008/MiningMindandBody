THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PLAY.

I.

THE following represents some of the ideas of a few authors who have written on this subject. It is believed that this resume will afford a good basis for an intelligent discussion.

Froebee.—The Education of Man.

“Play is the self-active representation of the inner representation of the inner from inner necessity and impulse.” “At this stage of development the young growing human being cares for the use of his body, his senses, his limbs, merely for the sake of their use and practice, but not for the sake of the results of this use (motive?). He is wholly indifferent to this; or, rather, he has as yet no idea whatever of this. For this reason the child at this stage begins to play with his limbs—his. hands, his fingers, his lips, his tongue, his feet, as well as with the expression of his eyes and face.”

Herbert Spencer.—The Principles of Psychology.

Spencer is the leading exponent of the theory, already suggested by Schiller, that play is an overflow of energy. In the case of the lowest animals, their energy is constantly taken up in functions which directly contribute to the maintenance of life. They are constantly occupied in obtaining food, avoiding or combating their enemies, or in making provision for their young. With animals of a higher type energy is not taken up exclusively in provision for their immediate needs. Their better nourishment affords an overplus of force. When their appetite is satisfied, there is nothing immediately driving them to obtain more food.

The greater complexity of their organization means a greater variety of activities, some of which do not obtain the opportunity for real functions except at long intervals. These activities need, however, to be used to some extent, to prevent their degeneration. The overflow of-energy brings them into operation, and the animal at such times which does not need to hunt pretends to do so and thus exercises his powers in play. These activities are hereditary and may be used in play before they function in reality. So the kitten pounces on a rolling ball, or after food and rest stretches its claws, or scratches them against the bark of a tree.

To this idea Spencer adds that of Imitation. When any group of brain-cells correlated with the functions to be exercised are so well nourished that they are ready to discharge their energy, the observation of real activities in others will so stimulate them as to precipitate or call out their powers. The imitation of real actions leads to play.

Both Spencer and Schiller explain all art as a form of play.

R. Wallaschek.—On the Origin o f Music, Mind, xvi (1891).

This author follows Spencer closely. “It is,” says he, “the surplus vigor in more highly evolved organisms, exceeding what is required for immediate needs, in which play of all kinds takes its rise, manifesting itself by way of imitation or repetition of all these efforts and exercises which are essential to the maintainance of life.”

Paul Souriau.—Le Plaisir du Mouvement.

There are various grounds for such a wide-spread joy in movements in the animal world. One of them is that in order to be fitted for all of its possible life task—obtaining of nourishment, escape from enemies, courting of mates, etc.,—the animal must possess a great capacity and, therefore, a great need for movement. When there is no opportunity for the real qualification of those needs, the instinct breaks bounds and

obtains its relief in play.”_“The need of movement will be especially

great in youth, because the young animal needs to try all the movements which he will have to execute later on, and to bring into play all his muscles and articulations, in order to develop them. Every animal has a tendency to expend each day a certain quantity of force, determined not by the accidental needs of the individual but by the general needs of the species.”

W. H. Hudson.—The Naturalist in La Plata.

In referring to the plays of animals this author remarks: “When the conditions of life are favorable, they are subject to periodical fits of gladness, affecting them powerfully and standing out in vivid contrast to their ordinary temper. And we know what this feeling is—this periodic intense elation which even civilized man occasionally experiences when in perfect health, more especially when young. There are moments when he is mad with joy, when he cannot keep still, when his impulse is to sing and shout aloud and laugh at nothing, to run and leap and exert himself in some extravagant way. Among the heavier mammals the feeling is manifested in loud noises, bellowing and screaming, and in lumbering uncouth motions—throwing up of heels, pretended panics, and

ponderous mock battles. In smaller and livelier animals the feeling

shows itself in more regular and often in more complex ways....Birds

are more subject to this universal joyous instinct than mammals, and there are times when some species are constantly overflowing with it. And as they are so much freer than mammals, more buoyant and graceful in action, more loquacious, and have voices so much finer, their gladness shows itself in a greater variety of ways, with more regular and beautiful motions, and with melody.”

GutsMuths—Spiele zur Uehung und Erholung des Kcerpers und Geistes.

The title of this book indicates its theory. The following legend which GutsMuths quotes will illustrate it further.

The apostle John was once playing with a partridge which he was stroking with his hand. Along came a man, apparently a hunter, and looked at the evangelist with astonishment, because he was taking pleasure insuch an unworthy manner, as it appeared to him, with the little creature. “Are you then really the apostle of whom all the world speaks, and whose reputation has reached far and wide? How can you make consistent such an amusement with such a reputation?”

“Good friend, what do I see in your hand?—a bow.—And why have you not it always strung and ready to shoot?”’

“That would not do; if it was always strung it would lose all its strength and soon be good for nothing.”

“Well, then do not be astonished at me,” answered the apostle.

G. H. Schneider.— Der menschliche Wille.

Hereditary instinct occupies the greatest part in play. The boy runs after and captures, and sometimes destroys butterflies, beetles, flies, etc., climbs trees at the risk of his life, to suck eggs or destroy and eat the young, because the perception of these objects awakens in him a strong desire or instinct to rob, hunt, and kill, and this plainly because his savage ancestors nourished themselves in some such way, as we may see now with the higher apes, who besides on fruit and nuts support themselves principally on small animals, especially insects, young birds and bird-eggs. Little girls and boys show in an unmistakable manner in their plays a hereditary capacity for the customs which are peculiar to their sex. Schneider thus looks on play as an after-effect of the working of intelligence in earlier generations. The combat plays of children and animals prise from the fact that their ancestors had to fight. The plays in which hiding of themselves or other objects are the interesting points are explained in a similar way. Instinct is explained on the theory of “lapsed intelligence,” rather than by a strict application of natural •selection. The fear of the dark is, for example, due to the inheritance of acquired associations.

Schneider also points out the value of imitation, which he regards as itself an instinct. The preception of movements in others, especially of one’s own species, will awaken a motor-image, which has sometimes an irresistable tendency to discharge. The gratification of this instinct, as with instincts generally, results in pleasure.

K. Lange.—Die bewusste Selbsttaeuschung als Kern des kuenstlichen Genusses.

The pleasure of art, as in play, is with conscious self-deception. This depends on the phantasy, or imagination. It arises from the need of positing an object or motive for the activity. The pleasure is greater when the activities are directed toward a motive, although the motive is known to be unreal. It is to be noticed that this motive is freely chosen, not imposed. As Dilthey says, “Art is play. The poet and the playing child each believe, the child in the life of his dolls and playthings, the poet in the reality of his creations, and yet neither of them really believe.’’ Lange claims that illusion plays occur in animals. The pleasure the kitten takes in running after a ball, or a dog in playing with a bone, is due to a conscious make-believe. Children’s plays with dolls are of the same character.

SOCIAL IMPORTANCE OF GYMNASTICS.

A Dedication Address held by E. H. ARNOLD, M. D., at Rockville, Conn.

THE great majority of the population of Rockville, I am told, are working people, people following industrial pursuits. Working people have, in the period of industrial depression through which we have just passed, learned to turn a penny twice before spending it. Such a lesson will not early be forgotten. It should apply especially to expenditures for things other than the mere necessities of life, such as amusements and pastimes. The building which we are about to dedicate is erected once as a place for legitimate amusement, on the other hand for a pastime, if I may be allowed to call gymnastics such. It is indeed named after the latter purpose, although the rooms allotted it in the building are neither the most conspicuous, elegant, nor spacious. Yet they are the ones from which the name of the building is derived, Turn-Hall, meaning a hall for gymnastic exercises. And it is only right that such a name should be selected, lor much as I admire this larger and better equipped hall, I hold the gymnasium part of the building to be the most important and, I am not afraid to say it, the only important part of the building. Without it there would be no excuse for erecting such a building, with funds contributed in part by working people. If I therefore now approach the question whether or not these funds have been well expended, my answer will only hold good if the gymnasium is in the time to come used by a sufficiently great number of people to derive benefits from such use. What are some of the beneficial effects of gymnastics ? you may well ask.

Gymnastics have in the first place a very decided effect on health. There is not an organ in the body that is not used in good all-around gymnastics. Just as a plow lying idle will become rust-eaten and therefore break under little force, so will idle organs in the body degenerate and make little resistance to influences tending to disease. Yes, more than that, non-functioning organs are in themselves a menace to health. This must be of so much more import in these times of economical division of labor for industrial purposes. In ye good old times, when

-225-

one mechanic and craftsman had to subject the raw material to numerous different processes to prepare it for the market, the danger of having any part of the body lie idle was little, for the processes were so manifold that they asked for their execution a great variety of bodily movements and brain functions or thought. That explains how work could be pursued in those times for fourteen or more hours per day. Iii our time labor saving machinery has sub-divided the different processes of manufacture so that one man subjects the article to one process or part of one only. This asks for the oft repeated performance of just one kind of movement of body and mind, while the rest of the body and mind are comparatively idle. That is the reason working hours have shortened in our times, working men and manufacturers willing or not willing. For the part of the human machinery exclusively employed in such work is, through continuous use without chance of relaxation and recuperation, easily tired out. This continuous work of one part does not only tire out early and easily the part in question from day to day, but it finally exhausts all the resources of that particular part forever. The truth at the bottom of the fact is, that people moving in a narrow circle of bodily activity decline early in skill and power of the parts overworked. Their industrial usefulness is shortened. The manufacturer does not find them profitable hands to keep, they are no longer skilled, spoil a great deal of the raw material, and turn out so little work that it does not pay to run machinery for them. They are, therefore, turned out and under. This is another danger accompanying the over-use of one part. The one resulting from the idleness of the other is by no means smaller, for while one part is tired out, the other is asking for some kind of activity. If this demand is not complied with, refreshing mental and physical rest, i. e., sleep, must not be looked for, nor a well-balanced mental and moral behavior. The nervousness of the people of our time and country bears witness to this fact. The demand for physical or mental activity of the idle parts is usuallj' so urgent that the person, without being conscions of it, complies with it. Most people do it in the form of some amusement, which explains the tendency of our times to indulge in all kinds of pastime. It is simply a physical and mental necessity. It is healthy and pays to satisfy the same. All Puritan preaching, all attempts at restriction by law are not going to change this tendency. The only hope to abate it would be to return to the the industrial method of our grandfathers. That such a hope could be realized no one believes, and very few people wish for its realization : human power cannot stop industrial evolution. It is not the least aggravating circumstance connected with this craving for amusement that satisfaction seems to depend not so much on the quality of the pleasure as on the quantity. If we consider that the source of this craving is the demand of certain organs of the body for a sufficient amount of activity to be as tired, as are the parts of the body that have been overworked, in order that the whole organism may -enjoy undisturbed rest, then it is easy to understand that it does not matter through what agency this tiredness is begotten. Do you want a better explanation of the ever increasing use of alcoholic beverages ? The general depression following its use, and especially its abuse, gives

—226—

the sought-for feeling of tiredness and the much needed undisturbed rest and sleep. That it especially depresses the functions of the brain, that it completely undoes the finely spun net of co-ordinate movements, make its effects especially gratifying to the consumer. How can this deplorable condition be changed ? Once, by giving people a better education. They will thereby be afforded a chance to understand and acquire a taste for better amusement, if amusement it must be. Then, by devising amusement of good quality.

1 am here to-day expressly to recommend to you gymnastics. And I take great pleasure in doing this because gymnastics are both part of a good education, and a pastime. As a pastime it satisfies the desire for all-around activity in the most thorough and natural manner. It is not followed by any of the undue effects of other means by which we intend to gratify our desire for activity and is therefore harmless. Wherever gymnastics are fostered they replace in a measure the more doubtful pleasures that people indulge in for the same purpose. Gymnastics are therefore a moral agency of the first quality. By supplying the demand for all-around activity in a way not detrimental to health, they tend to keep all organs functioning. That means good condition of all organs, health of the body as a whole. This in turn means prolongation of life. It means the maintenance of skill and thereby the ability to earn a living for a longer period than when the demand for activity is either not supplied at all or in a way detrimental to general health.

But gymnastics have an educational value. They give economy and steadiness of movement. These two qualities give it a commercial value because they make a good mechanic, for they mean skill. Gymnastics are a mental training at the same time, they train all the senses, eye and ear and touch.

We all recognize the importance of the health of these organs, but few realize what commercial value good eyes, ears, and touch have. Gymnastics give the power of attention, without which no knowledge can be acquired. Gymnastics make correct thinkers, and what is especially important, people that think quickly. What a formidable armament a gymnast then has to enter the battle of life with! Are good health, strength, long life, good morals, a trained eye, a skillful hand worth the expenditure that you have asked the individual and your society, to make in order that a place for the dissemination of these gymnastic benefits may be established and maintained ? To ask the question is to answer Yes! and a thousand times Yes! and forever Yes I

EXTRACTS FROM EUROPEAN JOURNALS ON PHYSICAL

TRAINING.

By W. A. OCKER, M. D.

THE long distance record, established by Loys at the Olympian Games in Greece, has recently been broken at a foot-race arranged by the “Petit Journal,” a Parisian newspaper. The victor, Mr. Leonard Hurst, ran the course Paris-Versailles-Conflans (which is very similar to Marathon-Athens, and 40 kilometers in length) in 2 hours and 31 minutes, thus breaking the record by 24 minutes. Out of the 280 contestants 223 finished ; the nine first beat the Marathon-Athens time, and 80 cohered the distance in less than four hours.

—A paper written by Dr. F. Schenk of Bern, Switzerland, on “Reform in Gymnastics” recommends the calling of a public mass meeting to consider the following propositions :

1. Gymnastic lessons in school shall be increased to six lessons a week.

2. To change the lessons from morning to afternoon.

3.	To agitate for larger open air gymnasia.

4.	To send a number of teachers abroad to study the German and English systems of gymnastics.

IS THE HUMAN RACE DEGENERATING ?

Prof. v. Pettenkofer has at various times made the assertion that such is not the case. The armor worn by the knights of the mediaeval period appears very large, but upon close inspection we find that our soldiers of to-day could not wear it. This the professor proves by saying that when the present Queen Victoria visited Scotland on her honeymoon trip, the nobility decided to celebrate a national festival in her honor, and in order to make it appear realistic thought they would wear the clothes and armor stored in the various castles. Upon trying on the clothes they were very much surprised to find the garments much too small, thus proving conclusively that the men and women of to-day have not degenerated, but are larger and better proportioned than the warriors of the past.

—Dr. Rabon of Paris recently published an interesting paper on anthropometry. After measuring thousands of persons of both sexes he comes to the following conclusions : The average height of a man 30 years of age is 1.68 meters and that of a woman of like age is 1.58 meters. Dr. Rabon has visited many museums, examined thousands of skeletons of the pre-historic people, and claims that men of the diluvial and alluvial epoch had an average height of 1.62 meters and the women an average of 1.50 meters. In the ancient period the average height of men was 1.66 meters and of women 1.55 meters. Men of the mediaeval period were 1.65 meters and women 1.55 meters tall. Thus the average man and woman of to-day is three centimeters taller than our predecessors of the diluvial epoch.

TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN RACE.

There has been a society organized in Brooklyn for the bettering of the human race. Following are some of the articles of the platform :

1.	That all children should be educated under immediate supervision of the state from the time the child is five years old until it reaches its fifteenth birthday.

2.	The education of all children should be first physical, second mental, third social.

3.	Children shall be allowed to choose any religion after their fifteenth year, but not before, as up to that age the power of judgment and discrimination is not sufficiently developed.

4.	All aged, mentally sound persons should be cared for at the expense of the state.

5.	Every person losing permanently three senses should be peaceably “electrocuted” by the state and all incurably insane persons are to be relieved in like manner.

FENCING.

The School of Fencing in Copenhagen, under the direction of Adj. Jens Bethelsen, is visited exclusively by ladies of the highest society. At a recent public exhibition a large audience was present; the various parries and thrusts were well executed, so much so, that the ladies are capable of competing with the best swordsman. Madame Anko-Heegard, the president, is recognized as the best fencer in Copenhagen.

A WONDERFUL GYMNASIUM ATTENDANCE

OF GREAT INTEREST, AND WHICH ST. LOUIS MAY WELL BOAST OF, IS THAT

OF THE SOUTH ST. LOUIS TURNVEREIN.

213 children, 123 boys and 90 girls, have in the past year never been absent from their gymnasium lessons, and 43 have only once failed to attend. These 213 are classified according to their age as follows:

43 pupils are between 15 and 18 years.

47 “	11	“ 13

Together 73 boys and 35 girls. These pupils frequent the gymnasium twice a week and as assiduously as patiently await the next lesson to come.

IN our last issue we took note of a prospective meeting of gymnastic directors of different colleges, and remarked that it was for the purpose of forming a permanent organization among themselves. This meeting is to take place during the Christmas holidays.

We heartily welcome any effort to organize societies for the improvement of gymnastic work, and all the more do we welcome this new move as a means of bringing athletics in closer relation with educational gymnastics ; but at the same time we are somewhat afraid lest this perhaps might involve a weakening of other organizations that have grown to national importance and cannot well spare such men as we find among the members of this new society.

In the A. A. A. P. E. we have an organization that has already gained some influence and a great many friends. Local and state branches are being formed all over the country. If properly supported, it is bound to become a body that commands the respect and admiration of every person in touch with education. In order to maintain its powerful influence it must continue to have the strongest support in its Central Board. College directors of gymnastics have from its very start taken a great interest in the A. A. A. P. E., and if this new society would imply a lessening of interest in the former, it would without doubt be a serious blow to it. “Viribus unitis” must be the motto of the teachers of physical training, for our battle against the obstacles to the recognition of scientific gymnastics has only fairly started. Under all circum-" stances we favor a strong A. A. A. P. E., and rather wish that nothing new be organized unless branches of this organization, than to see a weakening instead of a strengthening of the mother-institution. We are satisfied with an organization of the proposed kind, but would like to see it organized in the closest sympathy with, if not as a branch, of the

A.	A. A. P. E., just as we would like to see some closer co-operation between this body and the Physical Education Department of the National Education Association.

Physical education of college students after all is but little different from that of other people of the same age. We would consider it an error, were it to propose a distinct variety of it.

DIRECTIONS TO DR. PFISTER’S ANTHROPOMETRIC

CHART.

THE chart has this advantage that it contains an exact description of how to take the respective measurements, besides the figures in the percentage columns, and that it can be used for either sex.

Nothing is easier than to fill out this chart and thereby completing it. Take the measurements as directed and put the results in the column “1st Measurement.” Then, starting from the figure of the first measurement, run along the horizontal line and make a mark between those two printed approximate figures which approximate your figure nearest. If, for instance, your pupil’s weight was 147 pounds the mark or dot should be placed in the first horizontal line between the figures 141 and 150. Do the same with the next measurement, and so down until you have placed the dots for every measurement. Then connect those dots by straight lines and you have a graphical demonstration of the measurement. You readily see where the line rurts to the left towards “Below the Average” or to the right towards “Above the Average.” After some time (one half or a whole school year) the same individual is measured again ; the result is recorded in the end-column “2nd Measurement.” The fresh dots are properly placed and connected by lines as in the first measurement.

Now observe where this second line differs from the first and where the pupil has improved.

If you take the averages of the respective measurements of a whole class and make a chart as you would for an individual, you can in the second measurement demonstrate where the whole class has gained or lost and draw conclusions as to the result of your work.

The Narragansett Machine Co., Providence, R. I., has on sale all the different apparatus. Where there is no money obtainable for the purpose, a tape-measure and a home-made measuring rod will suffice to make most of the measurements. It is not absolutely necessary that all the measurements should be taken ; it is only desirable.

Pupils as a rule are very much interested in their chart as a record # of their development and are willing to pay from 50 cts. to $1.00 for a copy. The small profits thus cleared could serve as a fund to buy a regular measuring apparatus and dynamometer.

Price of Dr. Pfister’s charts : per hundred, $2.00 ; per dozen, 25 cts.

CORRESPONDENCE.

C. Emery.—You will find sample and instruction with this issue of “Mind and Body.”

M. Str.y Denver.—Of course, you can use home-made instruments. The Narragansett Machine Co. of Providence, R. I., can furnish you with everything. Send exercises. We shall make use of them occasionally.

G. Seikel.—You measure the “depth of chest” from the nipple-line on sternum to a point on the spinal column right below the lower angles of the shoulder blades. We do not dispute that this may not be just as correct as other forms of taking this measurement, but we can only compare results if all of us measure alike, and the great majority measures as you see it explained on the chart of

Dr. Pfister. The lower angles of the scapulae of some persons are situated relatively higher or lower than in others, and occasionally one is considerable lower than the other one in some individuals.

Dr. W. A. O.—This shows the right spirit. Do not wait too long with the article.

Mrs. Frances W. Leiter.—Your appreciated letter will be a stimulant to us, especially in the particular direction. Thanks.

TO CLASS LEADERS AND ACTIVE MEMBERS OF SOC’S.

Under this column we would like to publish your opinion upon practical subjects.

We will gladly revise articles and withhold names if so desired.

Come forward with your opinions and.experience, all of you.

QUESTIONS.

1.	Is it fair to our Societies and good policy for the success of a festival to compell members who wish to compete in any contest to make application three weeks before, and not to consider any that come later ?

2.	Is bicycle racing a successful acquisition to our festival program ?

Mr. Editor:—In answer to the question about the proposed new uniform for our active members in your last issue, I venture to voice the opinion of many actives by stating that knickerbockers and long stockings are not a proper part of a costume for men to wear; it looks too boyish, besides being too conspicuous for good taste.

The cream colored shirt may show off better when new and clean, but is harder to keep so, and when not made of flannel is not as protective hygienically as our old stand-by. The short gray jacket is very acceptable with our present uniform; it completes the outfit and covers a long felt want, especially for street use on festivals.

The argument of some of our short pants advocates, that better results can be accomplished in jumping, running, etc. by wearing the short garment, is in my opinion more imaginary then real. Long stockings fastened above and short pants fastened below the knee are to my experience more restraining to the free movement of $he knee-joint than long pants. As the foot-straps can easily be removed for running or jumping I don’t see the advantage gained by the proposed change. In regard to records made and yet to make in this line natural talent and hard practice, and not a certain style of costume was, and will be, the main feature.

To using spiked shoes for our field-sport contests I object for the reason that a Turner, according to my conception of the term, should never use artificial means for the sake of gain in any contest, physical or mental.

Let us be and remain natural, even at the risk of being a few inches behind our athletic adversaries.

Our principles declare for physical and mental development aiming at health and happiness only, and not for breaking records or training specialists who have to use such means for their business.

The girls stand in a circle at ordinary distance between them. During the first part of the song up to the words “washer women do/’ they take step-position right and left alternately with rising on toes. With the word indicating the action of washing, wrenching etc., they execute a corresponding movement. If interest continues, any number of actions as mending, scrubbing etc., may be gone through with.

Another variation of this game that our girls play consists in naming the days of the week, on which the different activities are performed. It is sung to a popular air with which most children are acquainted.

A large circle of players represents the boundaries of the lake. A smaller circle inside are the fishes. The “fisherman” stands between the two circles and gives each fish a name. Then the two circles walk around in opposite direction singing the song. During the words : “Heigh ho ! heigh ho ! here are we !” the circles take galop-steps, but walk again during the remainder ot the song. At the words: “The goldfish (whitefish, sunfish, herring, perch, pike etc.) come follow me!" the fish named steps out of the inner circle and takes hold of the fisherman’s hand and walks with him in the same direction as the large circle is moving. The song is repeated until all the fishes have been called and form a circle with the fisherman. To close the game the song is sung again and the two circles hop in galop-step in opposite directions until the verse is ended.

THE PLAYTHINGS OF JAPANESE CHILDREN.

By COUNTESS ANNIE DE MONTAIGUE.

THE Japanese are expert toy makers, and the artisan expends infinite time and patience in the manufacture of the quaint dolls, miniature horses, queer-looking soldiers, animals, and kitchen utensils for the little men and women who dwell in the land of the Mikado. Many of these objects are admirably modeled from bits of clay or coarse papier maehe. Every accessory is perfect, and the workman does not neglect even the minutest detail.

A stranger could form a very correct estimate of the every-day life of Japan by carefully observing the toys of the country. The shelf-god, who is a sort of protective household deity, is always included among the domestic paraphernalia of the tiny brown housekeeper.

A special fete day during the year is reserved for the little ones; this is called “Hina-matsura,” or the Feast of Playthings ; on this occasion the children are presented with a number of gifts, and these toys must be preserved with the greatest care. If the child breaks and destroys them, it is punished by being deprived of the highly-prized objects during the ensuing year.

The feast of dolls is quite a solemn and important affair, for these mimic men and women must not be touched, but only looked at from a respectful distance.

Five or six shelves, covered with scarlet cloth, run the whole length of the room, looking like so many steps ; upon these elevations are placed the effigies representing the different occupations, the national costumes, and life conditions of the people. Some of the dolls are extremely valuable, being made of solid silver and artistically painted ; lacquer, wood, and papier mache are generally used. The dolls are some of them as much as a hundred years old and have been carefully dressed in costumes, both ancient and modern ; but historical toys, illustrative of the manners and costumes of the olden times, are exhibited. There are lacquer trays, with miniature cups, plates, and bowls, filled with the proper food, set before these puppets. Pale lime-colored tea-steams in tiny cups of egg-shell china, a pot of Sake has been brewed for the occasion, the rice-bowl is piled with snowy grains, and salted fish, fruit, and condiments are temptingly set forth.

Realism is carried to the extremest point, ais the food is renewed three times a day for three days. At the expiration of that period the playthings are carefully wrapped in paper and put away in the storehouse, not to see the light again until the following year.

When a girl is given a doll she is admonished to handle it with: great care, for it must be preserved for her children and grand-children. This would be a good lesson for American girls to learn, who rather delight in destroying than preserving their playthings, and who, unlike the Japanese children, long for constant change.

In the streets of a Japanese village one notices groups of gaudily-attired boys and men flying splendid kites, which are made in the shape of gigantic birds, fish, symbolic animals, butterflies, and flowers. These make charming bits of color in the clear blue of the heaven, which seem peopled with flocks of gayly-plumaged birds and monstrous rainbow-tinted flowers. Babies, dressed in long cloths, aeolian harps, horses, elephants, and grinning monsters are also noticeable. These kites are kept steady by means of two long tails fastened at each corner.

The juveniles manage the yards and yards of string with a dexterity born of constant practice, and although the passer-by sometimes becomes entangled in the cord, nobody seems to mind. Fortunately, time is of no account in this land of heaven, and as everybody is good-natured, no rebukes are offered.

Fireworks play an important role on festival occasions. The children, prettily dressed, are given quantities of these combustible toys; in their quaint robes of tinted silk and gauze they make a charming picture, fluttering about like so many gaudy-painted birds. Many of their fireworks are similar to ours, for the Chinese and Japanese invented the fire-balls, pin-wheels, Roman candles, and rocket, which delight the young people of our own land.

A love of everything beautiful in nature and art is instilled into the minds of the children, who are passionately fond of bright-colored pictures, flowers, and birds. There are days in the year dedicated to the celebration of the flowering of certain blossoms, and their advent is heralded in the local newspapers.

The girls and boys, as a reward for good behavior, are given a holiday on these occasions, when the parents arrange picnics for their enjoyment. The little ones appear to revel in the lovely sight of bios-soming flowers as well as their elders.

Children, instead of making mud pies, amuse themselves by planting: miniature artificial gardens with tiny mounds, bits of rock work, and sanded pathways, shaded by plants in lieu of trees. The amateur landscape gardener accomplishes marvelous results in the area of one or two-feet square.

The little tots are fond of candy, in the shape of flowers, and brightly colored and sugared cakes of rice and barley paste.—From The Teachers' Institute.

—Healthfulness of Cycling. After a prolonged consideration of the subject, the Paris Medical Society has come to the conclusion that cycling is excellent exercise for healthy people, is very beneficial for those suffering from nervous disorders, but is undesirable for delicate people who are liable to suffer from over-fatigue.

BICYCLING FOR WOMEN.

As I am not a “scorcher,” a skirt reaching nearly to my ankles is good enough for me, and has never given me any inconvenience except when I was learning to ride, making it somewhat difficult to mount, which resulted in a torn skirt. The only proper place to wear bloomers is in a gymnasium or a riding school. But after learning the art of mastering the wheel the bloomers should be discarded. A woman with bloomers looks less graceful on a wheel than her sister with a short skirt. To my judgment a woman appears more graceful on a wheel than her brother. The majority of men and boys who ride wheels in my town resemble dromedaries more than human beings. They go spinning about with head thrown downward, back humped, and coat-tails flying. Who admires such a scene ? Probably the legislature of Kansas.

As to the injury a wheel with a proper saddle does a woman, there is none if not ridden to excess. Over-eating is harmful, so is excessive riding. In speaking of the non-injurious effects of the wheel, I mean the moderate use of a wheel with an anatomical saddle. •

As to the distance a woman should ride, a specified number of miles could not be given. One woman will ride twenty-five or thirty miles with less exhaustion than another could ride five miles. She should stop riding when she begins to get tired, or dismount and walk a short distance, which will rest her and then enable her to ride a longer distance with more pleasure and comfort.

A saddle should not be too long, but should be sufficiently wide to support the tuberosities of the ischia. A saddle which allows the weight of the body to rest on the perinaeum is injurious to both man and woman.

I have not had a case to my knowledge where a sexual disturbance was aroused from pedaling, although I have heard of one case, but she used an improper saddle and her character was not above reproach.

I have heard of several cases where the wheel has done more for the health of women than medicine. It has cured some cases of dysmenorrhea, constipation, hemorrhoids, insomnia, and other neurotic disturbances; also improved the circulation where there was an organic heart-lesion. Such patients should be under the supervision of a physician* It has also lessened the doses of morphine and lengthened the corset string.

I am sure the bicycle will do more for increasing the health and strength of women than any other one thing will or ever can do. To the physicians it will lessen the number of their gynecological patients.

Some speak of the sewing machine versus bicycle. The posture the woman assumes with each is quite different. At the sewing machine she stoops forward to focus her eyes accurately upon her work. While in this position the pelvic contents bear the weight of the abdominal viscera which are pushed down by the corset steels. The motions of the legs are short and rapid, therefore a constrained position. The time
-240-

em ployed at the sewing machine is frequently from morning until evening and always indoors.

A woman on a bicycle should wear no corset, or one that is loose, sit erect, saddle so adjusted as to be over a point midway between the hub and front rim of the rear wheel, and at a height to get a full, free, slow sweep of the whole leg.

Equilibrium is maintained by the hands resting on the handle-bar, arms also Gearing part of the body-weight. This gives exercise to the muscles of both extremities, also the chest and abdomen. The wheel is seldom used more than a few hours each day, and always in the open-air.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION . SOCIETY.

A MEETING of the Physical Education Society of New York and Vicinity was held in the hall of the Ethical Culture School, 109 W. 54th Street. The subject of the evening, “Outdoor Gymnastics and Playgrounds,” was introduced by Mr. Jacob A. Riis, who pointed out the moral as well as the physical value of playgrounds.

“A healthy boy has an irresistible impulse to play ; if his energy is corked up, he explodes in mischief and violence, and the boy becomes an unnatural boy, ‘a tough.’ Such a boy feels that he has been robbed of something, and especially loves to annoy policemen, who are the embodiment of the power that restricts him.”

The speaker gave several instances where a neighborhood infested with gangs of vicious boys became transformed into a safe and peaceable district after the opening of a playground or small park. The streets are at present the only playgrounds for the large majority of the New York children, and one could not wonder that the graduates of such training were often lawless or vicious. Crime was largely a question •of athletics.

In conclusion Mr. Riis made the following specific suggestions :

a)	That sand-hills and playgrounds be provided in the large and small parks ;

b)	That playgrounds be provided adjacent (not over) the public schools ;

c)	That disused city cemeteries be converted into playgrounds ;

d)	That market playgrounds be established ;

e)	That a playground be established near the east side settlement;

f)	That a municipal advisory committee on playgrounds be appointed.

The above recommendations were formally endorsed by the society. The acting chairman, Dr. M. P. E. Groszmann, referred to the prevalence of nervous affections in city children, largely due to in insufficient exercise out of doors.

A series of lantern views, loaned by Mr. W. L. Coop of Providence, illustrating outdoor gymnasia, was exhibited. The descriptive text was read by Miss Elizabeth MacMartin, director of the Charlesbank Outdoor Gymnasium, Boston.

Municipal outdoor gymnasia have been established in this country in

Boston and Chicago, the grounds in the latter city being equipped by the North American Gymnastic Union. The Boston grounds are said to be visited by from one to three thousand persons daily. Mayor Quincy says that the municipal playgrounds are the best investment ever made by the city of Boston, and recommends an appropriation of $200,000 for their extension’ The advantages of equipping schools with simple apparatus, as has been done in Sandusky and Providence, was pointed out.

Before adjourning, the society adopted the following resolution :

Resolved, that the Physical Education of New York and Vicinity is opposed to the use of military drill in public schools as a means of exercise.

OHIO PHYSICAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION.

THE Third Annual Meeting of the Ohio Physical Education Association (branch of the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education) was held at Dayton, O., November 26 and 27. A two day’s meeting was held, including business and public sessions with an exhibition of games and plays. Friday afternoon was taken up by the reports of the committee on publication and bibliography. This committee endeavored to secure accurate and complete information regarding physical training as at present carried on in Ohio, its nature and extent, the material equipment available, the teaching force, etc. Mrs. F. W. Leiter of Mansfield reported on the work done in institutions affected by the act passed by the Ohio Legislature in 1892, which provides that physical training “shall be included in the branches to be regularly taught in the common schools in cities of the first and second class, and in all educational institutions supported wholly or in part by money received from the state.”

Dr. F. E. Leonard reported for the colleges, and Mr. W. E. Day of Dayton for the Young Men’s Christian Association.

Complete statistics of the Turner societies having been already published in the annual reports of the North American Gymnastic Union, no report was read.

After these reports it was decided to hold future sessions in connection with the Ohio Teachers’ Association, as a section of that body.

Dr. T. D. Barker presided at the public session. Rev. E. E. Baker, D. D., made a pleasing address of welcome which was responded to by Dr. Leonard. Dr. Carl Ziegler of Cincinnati read a paper prepared by Dr. L. K. Baker, of the Cleveland public schools, on Plays and Games. Then followed gymnastic games and plays : Corn Cutter, Y. M. C. A.; Three Deep, W. C. A.; Granny Off, D. V. G.; Hurdle Racing, Turnge-meinde ; Circle Ball, D. V. G.; Pommel, Y. M. C. A.; Chain Tag, Y. M. C. A. Intermediates ; Snake Tag, Y. M. C. A. Seniors ; Flag Race, Y. M. C. A.; Skip Away, D. V. G. and W. C. A.; Team Racing, Turnge-meinde ; Volley Ball, Y. M. C. A.

An informal reception with refreshments concluded the evening’s entertainment.

Saturday morning was consumed with miscellaneous business. The
-242-

following executive committee was chosen for the coming year : President—Dr. F. E. Leonard, Oberlin ; Vice-Presidents—Dr. Carl Ziegler, Cincinnati, and Dr. Karl Zapp, Cleveland ; Secretary, pro tern.—Miss Elizabeth Barrows, Oxford ; Treasurer—W. E. Day, Dayton ; Frances W. Leiter, Mansfield ; R. Anna Morris, Cleveland ; W. H. Kinnicutt, (Cleveland.

After the report of the technical committee came a paper on “An Ideal Lesson in Gymnastics ; its Objects, the Arrangement of Material, the Methods of Instruction,” by Mr. Anton Leibold of Columbus.

In the afternoon the Dayton gymnasia were visited, including those of the Women’s Christian Association, Young Men’s Christian Association, Dayton Turngemeinde, Tumverein Vorwarts, Gymnastic Club, and Dayton View.

The local committee which made the arrangements for the convention was composed of W. E. Dav (Y. M. C. C.), Miss Nellie Fogle-rsong (D. V. G.), and Miss Sarah C. Wells (W. C. A.).

PLAY METHODS IN SCHOOL.

“Sense training and the proper method of introducing play into educational systems” was discussed by the principals of the Chicago public chools at their regular monthly meeting in the Schiller Building. ' ‘Superintendent Lane presided.

Papers treating of the subject were read by J. H. Stehman, principal of the Avondale School, and Miss A. E. Butts, principal of the Chase School. Principal Stehman said. Nature has endowed man with senses and sense perceptions that he may become familiar with his environment. The senses are capable of being trained and the first six years of a child’s life are naturally largely devoted to training his senses. Therefore there should be more of sense training in school. Nature intended that the early part of the child’s life should be devoted to play. A skillful teacher can introduce play methods into the school and use them as a means to an end in an educational way.

Miss Butts spoke of Chicago being the first city in the country to adopt a practical method of using play forms in the development of the senses. No other city has made a practical application of this.

BOOK REVIEW.

—Health of Body and Mind. By T. W. Topham, M. D.—This book differs materially from the ordinary text book on gymnastics inasmuch as it centers its attention mainly on preventive and curative measures, giving abundant rules and regulations. It ought therefore to be properly called a hygieno-gymnastic publication. We can not agree with all the claims advanced and views taken, but the work is evidently based on original thought. It contains a great deal of truth and much matter of importance and interest for the student of physical education. We recommend it therefore very highly for careful study.—Published by the Book Publishing Department, Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, N. Y.

—Report of the Commissioner of Education for the Year 1895-96, Vol.

II.	Washington. 1897.—In this very interesting compilation we find an exhausting report on the “Olympic Games of 1896” from the pen of Baron de Coubertin, the instigator of the revival of these games. Although containing little that is novel, the article is full of enthusiasm and free from favoritism either toward his own or any other nation.

ATHLETICS.

NOTES AND COMMENTS.

—The bicycle “scorcher” evidently has a hard time of it in Detroit, as the wheels of the bicycle squad of the police force are fitted with speed indicators, so that the cycling “copper,” by riding along with the “scorcher,” can readily tell whether or not he is exceeding the lawful limit.

—Athletics hold an important position in the schools of Japan. Once a year there is a gathering of all the students in a district to engage in athletic contests. At one of these festivals 6000 boys and girls from all the schools within a distance of 25 miles were entered to take part. A circular race track, roomy enough for an army, allowed four different kinds of games to be performed at the same time.—Boston Herald.

—A new gymnasium is to be built for the University of Pennsylvania that will cost $200,000. The cause of physical education is growing.

—The Young Men’s Christian Association in Cleveland, O., has classes in boxing, wrestling, and fencing.

—The good old Irish game of hand-ball is very popular in Chicago, 111., and Scranton, Pa. Indoor base-ball also flourishes in the former city.

—Anti-football legislation has been passed in Virginia and Georgia.

—C. S. Reber of St. Louis, who has held the amateur American record lor the running broad jump, 23 feet 6V2 inches, won the Western Association championship, doing 21 feet IIV2 inches.

—In a 160 yard (10 lengths of pool) swimming contest at Philadelphia Dr. Neumann defeated William A. Christy, National Swimming Association, in the first heat in 2:16 3-5. Donald M. Reeder defeated Harry Kollock, National Swimming Association, in the second heat in 2:12 3-5. The third heat was won by W. B. Kugler, National Swimming Association, who defeated Dr. Charles Gartell, University of Pennsylvania, in 2:23 2-5. Reeder won the final heat by eight yards in 2:18. Kugler was third by three yards. Dr. Neumann has a poisoned arm and was not at his best.

—The foot-ball team of the Northwestern University was materially weakened on account of the Life Saving Bureau at Washington, D. C., forbidding some surf-men, who are members off the team, to play.

—A wheel which is not to be used for some time should have its tires blown up tight before being laid away. If it is possible, the best plan is to have an arrangement of cords and pulleys in the ceiling of a dry room by which the wheel could be hung up. If this is not convenient the wheel should be put away in a place where it will not be likely to receive chance blows. The tires should be examined from time to time to see that they do not become deflated. A deflated tire is in danger of being worn against the rim. To keep dust out a sheet should be thrown over the wheel. The room in which the machine is kept should not be too warm, as heat is apt to shrivel the rubber and cause it to crack from dryness.—Chicago Record

—George L. Cadwalader, the Yale foot-ball player, is a native of California.

—Discus throwing has been added to the list of athletic events at Yale.

—Philadelphia is to have an open air gymnasium, modeled after the Charlesbank “Gvm” in Boston.

—C. M. Powell, the Cornell high jumper, is improving steadily and looks forward to beating Windsor at Mott Haven next year.

—Rutgers College is making an effort to revive aquatic sport. If enough money is raised a new boat-house will be built and crews organized.

—Golf is very popular at Smith College and also at Wellesley.

—“Jimmie” Michael, the “Welsh Rarebit,” is the king of long distance bicycle riders. His phenomenal records are in part due to his small size, as the “sexes,” “quints,” and “quads” used in pacing him afford much more of a windshield for him than they would for the ordinary racing man.

—President Eliot of Harvard University, in a recent interview, says in regard to football legislation: “The grounds on which arguments are based for the legal prohibition of intercollegiate football do not seem sufficient, in my mind, to warrant favor. But if we stop to consider other sports, we find that there are every year serious accidents in baseball, fencing, and other gymnasium games. Rowing and sailing are enjoyable pastimes, yet one reads of many drowning accidents every year. This does not seem to lessen the interest in rowing and sailing. — Everybody cannot play football. It is only the strong and well-built men who can expect to play the game with any degree of success. Therefore, I do not favor football for everybody. So I think football should not be prohibited without just cause. I have never heard of any city or state ordinance prohibiting the playing of the game before the bill in Georgia was passed. And, I repeat, the grounds on which the passing of that bill was effected are not sufficient to attract my favor.”

—Bernie Wefers, the wonderful sprinter, has been judged not guilty of professionalism by the Board of Governors of the Amateur Athletic Union. Things might have been different if Caspar Whitney had been home.
