GYMNASTIC NOMENCLATURE.

BENDING.

0 bend means to curve, to make crooked, to deflect from a normal condition of straightness. The head can of course not be bent on If and as we have designated its movement on and with the cervical ? as lowering and raising we shall discard the gymnastic term d the head.” The trugk may be bent/ It can be bent in all four lions, namely: forward, sideward left and right, and backward, n we use the term '‘bend the trunk” we mean according to the ve definition that the trunk as a whole should be curved, should be iected from its normal condition of straightness. We presuppose the ink to be relatively straight if considered as a whole. We are not •rned with the fact that the spine of the trunk is curved in two tions, nor do we wish to limit the bending movement to any par-lar joint or joints. Our command conditions onty that the trunk all be curved in a given direction from its apparent straightness. It not matter with regard to our command in which region of the the movement of joint or joints occurs. It makes no difference

under our command whether this movement is accomplished by further curving the spine in a region where it is already curved or by straightening an pre-existing curve or both. We wish to indicate by our command that the trunk is to bend upon itself and that each and every joint which can or must participate in the movement in order that the movement may be produced in the degree and direction given by the command shall be used for the purpose.* In a trunk bending forward, for instance, the trunk is curved by bending the spine still more in the dorsal and by straightening it in the lumbar region with as much lowering of the trunk forward, which is a movement in the hip joints, as is necessary to make the movement of the degree ‘'forward.’’ Likewise are we not satisfied if the command “Trunk backward-bend” be given with an attempt to straighten the dorsal spine but we wish the curve in the lumbar region to be increased and a corresponding movement to occur in the hip joint. Our nomenclature allows us to differentiate between the lowering and bending of the trunk, making provision thereby for the use of both movements. All the trunk movements except the forward one are self-limited ; the latter is possible in two degrees, namely, “forward” and “fore-downward.” The arms being in their usual position in a condition of approximate straightness may be bent from that position. The bending occurs in the elbow joint and as that joint allows of movement in one plane only no need of signifying the direction of the movement arises; the movement is self-limited. Bending of the arms occurs in placing the arms in certain starting positions, for instance, “Hands on hips-place,” “arms to thrust-bend,” “neck-firm,” “hands on shoulders place,”, etc. The bending being understood, no mention of it is made in the commands; this is good practice as the bending is, in assuming these positions, not the only movement executed, raising and turning being necessary for the performance of this or that one. All the movements must in such complex moves be held to be of equal importance, and therefore preference is shown for no one by not mentioning any.— The legs may be bent. The movement takes place in the knee joint, accessory movements are executed in the hip and ankle joint. The command universally used is “Knees-bend.” The movement is possible in one plane and direction only. When standing on all of the foot the movement is self-limited. If the heels be raised the knees may be still further bent. As this complex movement of heel raising and knee bending is often made use of it deserves perhaps of a special command. As it is the degree of the move which makes necessary the heel raising, the latter may be assumed to be included in the command if the degree is given. “Knees deeply—bend!” will serve the purpose. This ends the list of bending which we shall now proceed to tabulate.

NOTES ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS OF

CHILDREN.

By W. C. GORE, The Univerisity of Chicago School of Education.

(From The Elementary School Teacher.)

-------\

(Concluded.)

But mv purpose was simply to write a brief indroduction to some extracts from reports on observations made by members of a beginning class in psychology. The following extract may be taken as illustration of the psychological unit in one of its simplest forms:

In the first grade an experiment was being made—some plates were put on the table and the children asked not to touch them. The teacher had hardly made the request when one boy put out his hand and touched a plate. She spoke of it again. He put his hands down as if to hold them. But it was only a moment before they were up, reaching for the plate again. He seemed to have a desire to do as he was asked and, I think, intended to do so, but his will power was not strong enough to control his hand.

Several members of the class have been studying the character of the responses to stimuli made by some of the children, noting especially whether, on the one hand, responses or reactions are made in a pretty immediate, direct, intense, or disconnected way, with little or no “stopping to think,” or, on the other hand, whether the responses are slow, delayed, thoughtful, self-conscious, or switched off possibly into unseen channels of association or of emotion. These expressions are not intended to be synonymous, but merely suggestive of a few of the various possibilities. A child whose responses are prevailingly of the former character might be called a “motor” child ; one of the latter character might be called a “sensory” child, following the ver}f convenient but somewhat misleading nomenclature suggested by Professor Baldwin in his Story of the Mind.

I will select first a number of extracts from reports of various students which were made with reference to a child, who seems be a pretty clear case of the “motor” type.

A child in the first grade has interested me very much. He is active, impulsive, and quick to respond to every stimulus. Everything he does seems to'be done without the least thought of why he is doing this thing. If told to do a thing he thinks only of the act and listens to no further details, but gets up to do it. For example, one day he was put on a stone committee, which was to gather stones on the following day. The latter part of the directions he did not wait to hear, but taking his partner started out at once to gather stones, and of course had to be called back. This thoughtless activity has led to selfishness on his part, I think, in that he responds so quickly as to think of no one but himself. He is also, I think, very domineering.

(The early and definite location of a child under some familiar ethical category is certainly not to be encouraged. The average moral “size-up” of a child is usually the most immoral thing that can be done for him. But the relating of a moral characteristic to some psychological characteristic is a very different proposition, and one from which help may be expected.)

I have still been interested in watching a boy in the first grade who is of an impulsive temperament. I have noticed that when a subject is particularly

Digitized by ^ ooQle
interesting to him he wants to talk and act continually. All his senses seem to be immediately excited to activity. A very good illustration of this was brought out in a recent lesson of science,, in testing different stones for their composition by pouring acid on them. Most of the children were content merely to watch the process without touching the stones unless they were told. Not so with this child. Even'after being told that he might burn himself if he touched the stones, he could not resist the temptation of putting his fingers to every tested stone.

The attention of the strongly motor type of child is hard to hold, because he has a tendency to seize upon the action before all the conditions are presented. Nor does he often want to be helped if he can possible help himself. Only after he has tried and failed does he seek conditions or assistance. A child of that kind in the first grade was attempting to write his name on the board. He had done it before, but the child next to him was writing backwards; so imitation got the better of a slightly formed habit and he too began to write backwards. He held to the correct form, but reversed the letters [mirror writing] until he reached the third letter of his name, the letter 1 noticeable for its height. Then habit reasserted itself and he made the letter correctly. Consequently the downward stroke of the 1 cut into the letter he had previously formed. He at once stopped; looked at it, and tried again, with the same result. After a verbal suggestion that he was writing backwards failed to help him someone began to write his name correctly on the board before him; but he'would not wait to see it finished. He tried again—still backwards. He saw that it was wrong and looked up for help. Watching the whole word written seemed to impress the direction on his mind, and he wrote the vcord from left to right.

Imitation is very strong in the motor tyj:e of child. He wants to “show” how the thing of which he is talking looks or is done. He is likely to accompany the word or action of another with action. Wednesday morning the first grade was listening to a story. One child kept breaking in upon the story with suggestions, but at last his attention was fixed. The teacher was describing a valley, level in the middle, with mountains on each side. As she showed with her hand the level and steep parts, the child with his head bend far forward, imitated every motion, even continuing the motion after she had ceased.

The extracts just cited serve to illustrate the extreme suggestibility and impulsiveness of the motor child. These qualities usually make for openess and frankness of character. His difficulties usually lie pretty close to the surface. As Professor Baldwin points out in the work already referred to (chap, viii, p. 174), the motor child is continually “ ‘giving himself away,’ so to speak, by constantly acting out his impressions, and so revealing his progress of errors.”

The “sensory” child, on the other hand, presents a far more difficult proplem. Observation, unaided by experiment, is often baffled by his action or lack of actions. It is puzzling to try to make out what is going on behind the scenes. “Where the child of movement speaks out his impulsive interpretations,” to quote again from Professor Baldwin, “this one sinks into himself and gives no answer.”

I am sure the caution of the following report is to be commended :

The child I have been observing in the kindergarten is slow in responding to stimuli. He is a child who, I believe, is maturing very slowly. He has what I would call a dull, dreamy expression, but I have not been able to tell whethcr-this is his natural expression or whether his mind, instead of being interested in the story or game at hand, is wandering. The teacher had told the children the same story several times, so as to have them become familiar with it. One morning she told them they might help tell the story. They all seemed very eager to tell it, except this one child. He sat very quietly while the story was being; told. Now whether his mind was concentrated on the story at hand or whether* it was wandering, I could not tell.

The “sensory” child is likely to be far less open to suggestion than

Digitized by <^.ooQle
the “motor” child, far less imitative, as the following incident with reference to the same child will illustrate:

One child in the kindergarten has been of special interest to me since the commencement of the observation work. I have worked with him at various things and he showed no interest whatsoever. [The fact that a student should take special interest in a child, because he showed no interest whatsoever, is sfgmiiciant, perhaps, of the kind of response observation work may call forth.] When told to do anything he would do it slowly, and carelessly, and aimlessly. AH the little ones were deeply interested in making envelopes, for example, with the exception of this one child. He would fold the paper wrong, and if he happened to fold it right it would be far from accurate. I would explain again and again how the seed would fall from such poorly made envelopes. He would listen and then make the next one as poorly as before.

There has been a great variety of observations on interest and attention, but it is impossible to arrange extracts from them in any systematic way. Taken in themselves they are pretty fragmentary and scattered, ranging all the way from the shifting play of interest and attention in the kindergarten to a case of highly specialized interest in one of the upper grades; but nearly every one would sdrve as a suggestion, a point of departure, for further observation and study.

The kindergarten children were asked to sit down in their chairs and pay attention to the drawing of a picture by one of the teachers. They are not often called upon to sit still and do nothing but attend, and it was interesting to note aad compare the different ones. Most of them soon tired of watching the development of the picture and began playing with those nearest to them. Two little girls paid attention in a way—they were not interested in the real development of the picture, but watched it closely to make some remark to each other about every new part. All were greatly interested in the picture when it-was completed, but paid very little attention to it until then. They had a motive or an end in view for attending to the development of this picture, but they were to young for such a vague motive to hold them to attention,

It will be noticed that this excellent bit of observation tends to fall into the “psychologist’s fallacy” at the close. The children may have been supposed to have a motive for attending, but that they really had a motive, or. that their tender age could keep an actual motive from operating, is exceedingly doubtful. A motive that can simply be entertained, that does not effect conduct, that does not stimulate some response or attitude, is a contradiction in terms. A motive that is not motor is a physical vacuum, which human nature abhors. This is not aimed at the report just quoted, which may have really meant something very different; but aimed—well, into the air, if you like.

There have been some reports on what appear to be the keenest interests of the children of the first two grades. I will make selections from two reports bearing upon the interest of constructive work, which on the whole, seems thus far to be the keenest of all. The question has been raised as to whether the social interest, sometimes called the altruistic interest, the interest in the social use to which the thing constructed is to be put, is not the dominating interest. The evidence bearing on this question has come out mostly in oral discussions, which I am unable to quote, but it tends to show that such is not the case. The interest in construction per se is livelier and more persistent. It can usually be turned and enlarged, if desired, to include the social
interest. The whole matter, it need hardly be said, is one that will repay further investigation.

Those things which the children can do and feel that they are of some value will be the things that interest them most. For example, the second-grade children have been interested in materials and fabrics, because they were choosing some material that would make the best holders to use in the domestic-science room. These holders were for the rest of the school, so we see they were to be of some use and were to be for somebody’s comfort. Therefore the children were interested.

The italics are mine. Here we have another beautiful case of the “psychologist’s fallacy.’’ I do not know of a better example of the tendency so prevailing a^mong us teachers to read our own sophisticated moral motives into and back of the acts of little children. I am not overlooking, I hope, the value and suggestiveness of the report just quoted in raising the question regarding the relative intensity of interests.

Here is the extract from another report bearing on the same point; italics mine:

All the children of the second grade are very much interested in weaving holders; so much so that yesterday morning before school they began to work on them without being told. They know the need of holders and would prop-ablv not care to make them if they knew no use to which they might be put. Still it is not their use alone, I believe, which stimulates the children to make them. For the most part the interest is in the activity itself. Children want to be doing something, using their senses, all the time.

It is noticeable that most of the observations bear upon the character of the motor responses, children being far more accessible to observation on this side than on the side of sense experience. It is possible, however, in some cases to get at the sensory side, as the following report, just quoted in part above, will illustrate. The incident will also be taken to illustrate the inhibitory effect of a slightly unpleasant sense Experience.

Each child chose the colors with which to make its own holder. One boy chose two that went well together, yellow and blue, but gave the yellow to another child, who needed it, and took green to finish his with. When he had woven the two colors together for a time he stopped working and said he thought it was not pretty; some other color would go with the blue better than green. His interest had subsided, and a teacher had to pursuade him to go on again. This child seems to be more sensitive to harmony of colors than most children.

The following brief extract suggests a good lead for further observation, especially on the sensory side:

As a whole the children in the kindergarten are very quick to respond to stimuli of the coarser nature, while those of the finer, such as a delicate touch, call forth little response. They do not mind if their envelopes are folded un-

evenly or cut in the wrong place. In fact, they would not notice it if their

attention were not called to it by the teacher.... Their observation out of

doors is very keen as compared with that of an older person.

In the following report there is an interesting and significant attempt, it seems to me, to connect the sensory and motor sides; that is. to make the “circuit”:

This morning I was practicing writing on the blackboard in the first grade room, before school. One of the children, noting the continuous line ol tn's I

Digitized by v^ooQle
was making, took up a piece of chalk and also began to make a line of them. His line, instead of being straight, first went up, then down. He did not notice the crookedness of his line, however, until a straight line was drawn just below the m's I had written. Then he began again, this time keeping the lower strokes ot the m's quite uniform but the upper ones still uneven. After noticing this he watched carefully both the top and bottom ot the letters and succeeded in getting the letters quite uniform in size, but in a very crooked line. It was evident that writing in a continuous straight line involved more new sensation than he was able to attend to at one time. Neither uniformity of size, continuous movement of the arm, nor measuring distance visually, were as yet fixed pathways in his brain. Hence, when his attention was focused on the one action, the others suffered accordingly, since his muscular apparatus was unable to adjust itself to fit so many new, incoming sensations.

It is worth while comparing this report with the selection first quoted in this paper. In that selection the “will” was appealed to as affording a sort of explanation. In this report note that the “muscular apparatus was unable to adjust itself to fit so many new, incoming sensations.” it is likely, of course, that there might be considerable difference of opinion as to explanations in either case. After all, the important thing to note is that some kind of psychological analysis and interpretation was brought to bear upon what might otherwise have been passed by as incident too trivial to mention.

The point of this paper is intended to be pedagogical rather than psychological. I have tried to show by means of a few illustrations how, in the course of an introduction to psychological principles, the minds of prospective teachers may be turned to an objective, analytical, and, in some degree, scientific observation of children.

TABLES OF GROWTH.

FRANCES MUSSELMAN, CAROLINE CRAWFORD.

CFrom The Elementary School Teacher.)	»

THE following studies and records of size and growth for age and sex are given as a suggestive outline for the teacher to use in studying the development of the child.

The tables compiled in America are placed together to bring out the variations found by the different investigators in the various parts of the country.

The most important study of these tables for the teacher is the observation of the normal annual increase in growth. While a child may be below or above an average size, yet the normal annual increase in development remains, in relation to that size, fairly constant. A falling below the normal growth-rate is often the first indication of a weakened physical condition, which may mean a failure to keep up with the grade, or, may be, even the graver sign, susceptibility to disease. An overgrowth annually may be the first indication of the sluggishness produced by the great amount of energy used in building the body. This must necessarily be at the expense of its action, unless the power of functional development is also far below the normal.

As the normal growth must be taken into account in preparing the school course, so the abnormal development, or the lack of development, should also be a guide as to the variation necessary in that prescribed course of study.

The tables of Porter are made from measurements of St. Louis school children; those of Bowditch, of Boston children (first column includes all nationalities, second column Americans); those of Christopher are made from Chicago children of American parentage; and the tables of Sargent include children from various parts of the country.

The height, standing, is taken without shoes. The weight, except in the Sargent measurements, includes the clothing.

The records are in centimeters and kilograms. To change centimeters to inches, divide by two and one-half. To change kilograms to pounds, multiply by two one-fifth.

DOMESTIC AND INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS.*

By PROFESSOR CALVIN M. WOODWARD, Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.

I NEED no statistics to prove that engineering schools and engineering departments as a rule take no active part in intercollegiate athletics. There may he exceptions, lmL we never hear of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or Troy, or Worcester, or Stevens, on the gridiron or on the diamond or in regattas. How the teams are made up at Harvard and Vale, Cornell, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, I do not know, but 1 suspect that student engineers arc generally ‘too busy’ to find time, and too interested in their work to feel an overmastering craving for athletics, so the athletic spirit which occasionally hursts into (lame is gradually quenched by the steady stream of ‘lectures’ and ‘laboratory calls.’

Doubtless we have all been somewhat to blame in this matter. We have seen so much that the student engineer ought to get and to do, and so much that the future engineer ought to know and to be, that we have pre-empted the students’ hours of play and recreation as well as their hours of study, and have overlooked the plain duty of attending to the physical natures and appetites of the young men in our charge.

It is mv conviction that we have made a serious mistake. To a certain degree we have defeated ourselves. Facilities and boards ot control have great rcsponsibiltics in the direction of athletics, which responsibilities in a vast majority of cases they fail to meet properly. Sometimes thev grossly mismanage matters, but more often they neglect them and try to ignore them. They let things drift. Thev admit in a hall-hearted way that physical culture i< a good thing, but thev discourage every development of athletics under student management, while they inaugurate no adequate management of their own. In many cases athletic managers, supported as they are by strong popular favor, are a sort of terror to tutors and professors; the compel them to assist or at least to wink at deception and dishonesty.

It is usless to expect clean athletics when the members of the faculty participate in or condone fraud and unfairness. I do not willingly admit tlie shortcomings of college officers, but their own confessions can not be gainsaid. I know of no more corrupting influence upon students than a dishonest faculty. You would be astonished and mortified if you knew the extent to which professors in reputable institutions make false returns of the standing of the players supposed to be indispensable to the success of a college team. The excuses they offer arc that they must make allowance for different standards, and hence some ‘diplomacy’ is necessary to secure a fair game; and secondly that the demand for leniency is so strong that it becomes a duty to the

institution they represent to exercise a discreet indulgence. It is extremely discouraging, it is said, to make a poor showing in what are popularly held to be manly sports, through the maintainance of high standards of scholarship. In one institution a student is held disqualified by dropping below an average grading of sixty or seventy per pent.; in another he is allowed to ‘pass’ on an average of thirty or forty per cent. Similarly the phrases ‘college grade’ and ‘post-graduate’ mean little or much according to usage. It is clear that the temptations to place new and unwonted meanings to the word ‘conditioned’ are very strong.

Has not the time arrived for a general conference of representatives from all institutions for higher education, whether literary or technical, for the purpose of formulating rules and adopting uniform standards in so far as they bear upon the question of eligibility to athletic teams? All admit that high standards are necessary in determining a man’s worthiness to be proclaimed an attorney, an architect, an engineer or a physician; while a more moderate standard may be admissible in the general studies which arc regarded as in no way professional. A university may require a passing grade of forty per cent, in its college of letters, but insist upon sixty or seventy per cent, in its schools of engineering, law and medicine. Evidently there should be no such discrepancy in determining athletic eligibility for intercollegiate games.

Local conferences have already been held, but I suggest an effort to bring together all institutions east, west, north and south, and if possible to adopt standards and rules that all can faithfully observe. My object to-day is to lav before yon some considerations in favor of the systematic management of both domestic and intercollegiate athletics in everv school or college of enginceing. and to submit some practical suggestions in regard of the latter feature.

I have recently given some thought to manly sports, and I venture a few words in regards to their value in every scheme of all-round education.

THE GENERAL VALUE OF SYSTEMATIC ATHLETICS.

The modern development of athletics has resulted from a combination of causes. The physical asceticism of the middle ages has passed away. Muscular Christianity is now the rule and not the exception. A weak, stunted and famished bodv is no longer regarded as a sure abode, not even as a promise, of a purified, robust spirit. The Roman motto of a sound mind only in a sound body is in universal favor.

Again, a continually diminishing proportion of the people are engaged in reducing the wilderness, in raising the crops and in rearing the stock which arc needed for food ; and as to the rest of us, we are walled up in great cities, roofed in from the sunlight and pure air, and then given a maximum of brain work with as little as possible of physical exercise. This state of things can not long endure without serious injury to our manhood. Close observers of the American people state that nervous diseases and all complaints arising from excessive brain work, combined with the lack of physical health and vigor, are steadily increasing and if we would avert the threatened physical degeneracy of our nation

we must consciously introduce physical culture and athletic games which shall strengthen our bodies and invigorate our minds.

The army and navy draw but a very small fraction of our youth to the fascinatiohs of military and marine life, and even the cadets must have their sports and games in addition to the routine of drill.

Perhaps we can leave mere fun to the children, but contests which task one’s strength and skill have perpetual charm for young men who are at an age to be delightfully conscious of their strength, and increasingly ambitous to exhibit their skill. Now, more than ever in history, opportunities for exhibiting strength and skill in competition must be manufactured. In primitive days the young farmer, the builder, the hunter, the soldier, found abundant opportunity to exhibit his prowess without modern athletics. The marked development of athletics during the last four years is due to no change in the mental, moral and physical tastes and appetites of young men, but to a social development which renders necessary special provision for the gratification of those normal tastes and appetites.

MANLY SPORTS VS. GYMNASTICS.

I find it necessary to make a distinction between manly sports and gymnastics. They agree generally in affording athletic culture, but they differ in order of importance they attach to exercise and to sport. Gymnastic training makes the exercise the main thing, while the pleasure and passion for competition and victory are secondary. It is just the other way with athletic games; with them the game is foremost, while the physical and moral benefits are incidental.

‘Athletics begin where gymnastics leave of.* There is no antagonism between them ; the one supplements the other. Every participator in field sports should bring to his games a body well developed by judicious gymnastic training. On the other hand the trained gymnast is entitled to the particular delights and rewards of athletic games.

THE ARMY OFFICERS’ ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.

WE are in receipt of the annual report of the above mentioned association for the year 1902. The A. 0. A. A. was formed 10 years ago for the purpose of encouraging and assisting such athletic sports among cadets of the U. S. Military Academy as may be permitted by the authorities of the institution and to encourage athletic sports throughout the army.

The officers for 1902 were:	President,	L:eut. Col. W. P. Edgerton; vice-

president, Lieut. Col. C. G. Treat; treasurer, Captain \V. C. Rivers; secretary, Captain P. E. Pierce; representative for football. Captain Richmond P. Davis; representative for general athletics, Lieut. H. T. Koehler: representative for baseball. Lieutenant L. B. Kromer, Lieutenant T. A. Roberts ; Representatives for tennis. Lieutenant F. W. Coe, Captain D. E. Nolan.—Assistant secretary and treasurer for the Philippine Islands:	Captain	Frank DeW. Ramsey, Treasurer ;

Captain Julian R. Lindsey, secretary.

The report shows a commendable appreciation of the value of physical training for the future soldier and of the splendid results achieved in its pursuance.

Space forbids us to reproduce the reports of the different sections, hut the report of the president is of such general interest that we reprint it with pleasure:

Gentlemen: It gives me great pleasure to report to you that the Army Officers Athletic Association has never been in better condition than during the past year, nor has it ever more satisfactorily fulfilled the purposes for which it was established.

The report of the treasurer will show you that we have not been lacking in funds and that our good friends both in the service and in civil life have responded to our needs in the most generous manner. As to what has been accomplished in the various departments of our organization during the past year I refer you to the reports of the representatives of those departments wherein are set forth many facts of a pleasing and encouraging nature. With this meeting the Army Officers’ Athletic Association closes the first decade of its existence. During these then years we have seen athletics at the Acaden.v grow Irotn a state of feeble uncertainty to their present condition of stability and assured recognition. When the Association was organized we were just entering upon the formative period of our athletic development. Hampered by many embarrassing restrictions, haunted by a feeling that the sacred traditions of the Academy were being trodden under foot on the football and baseball fields, harrassed by doubts as to the expediency of it all, as to whither this evolution might lead us, we were groping in the dark, upheld only by the conviction that our purpose was a worthy one. Now we know that our efforts as a whole have been directed with good judgment and have been crowned with a success far beyond our most sanguine hopes. Our triumphs in football, baseball, and fencing

are known to all and are matters for sincere pride and congratulation. They are the tangible and inspiriting rewards that spur us on to renewed efforts. Rut I wish to speak of other results, farther reaching in their character and of much more lasting satisfaction than the temporary triumphs of the football field. To fully appreciate them and to realize the meaning of our success in establishing athletics at the Academy, it is necessary to look back some fifteen years and contrast the conditions then existing with those of the present. Then cadet life at the Academy was stern, harsh, almost prison-like. The young men were not supposed to possess the instincts and desires common to youths of their age throughout the land; the only amusements accorded them were the dubious ones of drill and study—their wildest gaieties were limited to a precise observance of the regulations of the Blue Book.

Now without sacrificing in any degree the rigid exactions of discipline and study; in fact while these requirements are materially increased, the cadets have the athletic recreations natural and most wholesome for their time of life. Through the medium of football, baseball, fencing, gymnastics, field and indoor athletics they bear the burden of the curriculum with lighter hearts, while their esprit de corps is greatly increased by the opportunities now given to measure themselves with the students of other institutions, and, incidentally, they are thus given a beneficial glimpse of that outside world which was formerly excluded with such care. Who can deny that the life Cadets of the present time are living is not more wholesome, more reasonable, more cheerful, and in all respects better worth living than the semi-convict life that was imposed upon the Cadets a generation ago?

When the Cadet of to-day graduates,' instead of carrying away a feeling of bitterness and resentment towards the Academy, such as was common among the graduates of the pre-athletic period, he bears in his mind memories of recreations and athletic triumphs which, interspersed with his studies and drills, softened the asperities of his student life, and he looks back to West Point with eagerness for news regarding the progress of our various athletic teams, takes a genuine pride in our victories and feels a sincere regret when we suffer defeat. In this manner the Academy is kept in close touch with the body of its graduates and their interest, although primarily it may be directed to the athletic features of our life, does not stop there, but embraces all those tilings that are of importance to our welfare.

Then, too, the work we are doing here and the success we are achieving, are not confined to the limits of the Academy, hut are having the proper and ligitimate effect throughout the service. With every class that graduates we scatter through the Army young officers imbued with the athletic spirit and filled with zeal lor the proper physical development of the men who shall be placed under their command. The result cannot but be beneficial to the rank and file of the Army at large. The men will be better soldiers, not only because of their improved physical training, but also in consequence of the more contented and cheerful spirit that must prevail where garrison life is robbed of half its monotony through the agency of athletic sports.

All this has been accomplished largely through the aid and eneouragment rendered the cause of athletics by .this Association, we have good reason to feel well satisfied with the results we have attained.

It is hardly necessary to state to those aquainted with the workings ol the( Academy that the Association could have aeomplished the results shown, and that it could have reached its present flourishing condition, only through the constant support and encouragement it has received from the Superintendent.

Very respectfully,

Wkic.ht P. Kpoerton, President.

An interesting feature of the proceedings was the presentation by Dr. J. E. Raycroft, Chicago I’niversitv, of a plaster model, one-quarter life size, representing the average American college athlete. This statuette was modeled Irom data obtained from the records of 400 athletes in the gymnasiums of Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Columbia and elsewhere. A significant laet was that this composite figure showed

no abnormal display of muscle, but a good all-round development. Dr. W. A. Lambeth, of the University of Virginia, urged that the physical work done by college students should be credited to them just as the other work of the curriculum. Considerable time was given to the question of fatigue and overexertion in physical culture. Dr. R. T. McKenzie, McGill University, read a paper on the “Effects of Overexertion in Athletics and Gymnasium,” and Dr. W. G. Anderson. Vale University, dwelt at great length on what had been accomplished toward determining when overexertion begins. The following officers were elected: President, L)r. Watson L. Savage, Columbia University; vice-presidents, Drs. J. W. Seaver and W. A. Lambeth. Virginia; sccrctary-tressurer, Dr. James A. Babbitt. Haverford College. The next meeting will be heid Dee. ‘51, 1903, at Princeton University.

Clear the floor of all the apparatus and line up for relay race in four teams. The teams may stand in flank or front order about two or three steps distance in the direction they are to run, at either end of the gymnasium. Every individual runs the full length of the enclosure and returns to the starting point, where he returns to the next member the Indian club, flag or whatever object to he carried over the course. This order continues until all have had their turns. Reform the class into a front line, dap hands and break rank.

BOOK REVIEW.

'All the books mentioned under this head may' be ordered from the Freidenker Publ. Co., Milwaukee.)

—Exercises Upon the Horse, Horizontal Bar, Parallel Bars is the title of a graded collection of exercises and combinations with a chapter on gymnastic nomenclature in pamphlet form, compiled by G. W. Ehler and A. B. Wegener of Chicago.

The work has a handy form: the leaves are loose with printing on one side only, which is just the thing for squad leaders. The book is evidently intended for such.

The paragraph on nomenclature comprises: terms, names of exercises, grasp in hang and support, the division of the body into its parts, the planes and axes of the body, the movements of the bod)* and of its parts, the apparatus, and the relative position of the gymnast to the same.

The arrangements of the grading of the material are good, and the variety offered in the combinations will not fail to stimulate leaders and pupils. But in many instances the authors should have been more explicit and also more consistent in terminology.

The terminology which the teacher offers the squad leaders (Vorturner) has much to do with making the work easy or difficult for the same. The whole is a praiseworthy attempt at translating the German terms; a number of the terms are taken from McQueen’s Translation of Puritz.—W.

—Fear, Anxiety and Grief in Childhood. Health in maturity is largely dependent upon proper care in childhood. The phvsician and the medicine chest represent one side of the care of a child; an even more important phase is the supervision of mental development. Fear is the most distressing element of childhood: fear of the dark, imaginary illusions, fear of animals and calamities, terrors engendered by alarming tales and superstitions. These, improperly controlled, do more toward wrecking the nervous constitution of the child, impairing the disposition and even the character, than anything else. Anxiety, as manifested in self-consciousness, is another harmful agent. Mrs. Theodore W. Birnev in a paper in the delineator for March gives some eminently practical suggestions as to how to control these mental phenomena. The article should be of intense interest to parents.

GAMES FOR SCHOOLS AND GYMNASIA. By W. C. SCHAEFER. Milwaukee, 1900. Freidenker Publishing Co. pp. 36; Bound half cloth. Price 50c.—The scarcity of text books on movement games for the girls and boys in our American public and private schools has long been felt as a grievous want. Of German books on the movement games there has never been a lack, but the English litterature was devoid of any acceptable collections of such games. Mr. Schaefer has undertaken the task to collaborate such a book with great insight and circumspection. The games are conspicuously arranged under different headings from sound pedagogical points of view and well classified for girls and boys. No teacher of our public, private, and gymnastic schools having Anglo-American pupils under his or her care can afford to be without this book. It embodies moral and physical as well as intellectual elements and is sur$ to attract the attention of every progressive pedagogue.

ATHLETICS.

THE TREATMENT OF FOOTBALL INJURIES BASED ON AN EXPERIENCE OF SIXTEEN YEARS.

By J. B. GARNETT, M. D., Assistant Surgeon tu the University Hospital.

I From Therapeutic Gazette )

(Concluded.)

CONTUSIONS are the most common forms of injury in football and mav occur on any part of the body, but they are rarely serious in their nature.

Immediateh' after a receipt of a contusion hot moist impresses should be applied for one or two hours to restore the tone of the injured vessels, and then pressure should be exerted upon the affected part by means of an adhesive plaster dressing or the application of a rubber bandage in order to limit the extravasation of blood and lymph. Massage should be commenced within 24 hours and should be continued twice daily until the exudate is completely absorbed and the part has returned to normal. The massage proves most efficacious when it supplements and immediately follows the application of hot fomentations or superheated air. Contusions do not necessitate the withdrawal of the player from practice or games, for the exercise incident to playing, provided the injured part is properly padded and protected from further bruising, proves serviceable in the great majority of cases by hastening the absorption of the inflammatory exudate. In a comparatively few cases, however, playing seems to aggravate the condition by causing an increase in the pain, swelling and tenderness. Under these circumstances active motion of the part should be temporarily suspended until the inflammatory condition subsides.

Contusions involving the anterior and lateral aspects of the legs are apt to be accompanied by a periostitis of the tibia and fibula because of the exposed and superficial position of these bones. This condition is not serious, is only moderately painful and tender and never goes on to suppuration, but the tenderness may persist for weeks and small bony outgrowths may develop. Except for wearing shin-guards, this condition requires no special treatment beyond that applicable to contusions in general.

Traumatic myositis affecting the muscles of the thigh anterior to the femur may result from repeated bruising of the inadequately padded thigh by an opponent’s shoulder in tackling, or it may result from overexertion of the muscles during the first few days of practice. The latter form is known to the football players themselves as “Charley-horse.” Both varieties are characterized l3y pain, tenderness, and deep-seated, board-like induration. The affected muscles are bound down by the deep fascia and are very tense on palpation. At times there is an exudation of bloody serum, when fluctuation may be obtained. The muscular fibers are rigid and are prone to rupture when the muscle is suddenly and strongly contracted, as in starting to run or attempting to kiek the ball. Under these circumstances the player usually experiences a

-20-

sharp stabbing pain and sometimes falls to the ground. On examination a gap will be found between the ends of the torn and retracted muscle. All active movements of the muscle are exeedingly painful, and there may be an extensive extravasation of blood. The treatment for myositis is the same as for contusion, except in the severer cases, where the thigh should be elevated and kept at rest. Multiple punctures may rarely be necessary for the relief of tension or the evacuation of serous exudate. This injury does not respond very rapidly to treatment, and the patient should be kept from playing until the induration begins to subside. Active exercices may then be tried cautiously, and if no ill results follow they may be continued in in?reas-ing severity until the patient is able to resume his position on the team. A repetition of the bruising is best avoided by the use of a large aluminum plate which is shaped like a tortoise shell and completely covers and extends beyond the affected portion of the muscle. It is held in place by a wide elastic band encircling the thigh and is padded on its outer surface to prevent injury of other players. In the event of a rupture of the muscle complicating the myositis a dressing of strips-of adhesive plaster should be applied over the course of the muscle in order to approximate the divided libers, put the muscles at rest, and limit the amount of extravasation.

Contusions of the muscles of the loin are generally produced by the impact of the head, knee, or head of another player, and while not serious it is a painful injury because of the impossibility of makings any movement of the body without bringing these muscles into play. The best treatment consists in applying an imbricated dressing of adhesive plaster to place the muscles at rest, and at the same time protect them from further contusions by means of a shin-guard attached vertically to the inner surface of the football jersey, so that the central portion of the guard is placed over the affected muscles and its ends rest upon the iliac crest and lower hips.

Contusions of the face are of but slight importance, except for the temporary disfigurement caused by the swelling and extravasation of blood. They are best treated by the application of cold to check the exudate of blood, and then by massage and applications of moist heat to encourage absorption. Rarely an extravasation of blood in the loose cellular tissues of the eyelids may cause so much swelling and interference with vision that it is advisable to evacuate the blood by incision.

Contusions of the external ear are sometimes accompanied by the formation of a hematoma. If small, an attempt should be made to cause absorption by pressure and hot applications. If large, it should be incised, the blood evacuated, and pressure applied to obliterate the cavity. Hematoma is apt to be followed bv the so-called “football ear,” which consists of fibrous thickening and permanent deformity of the external ear.

Mild concussions of the brain, presenting symptoms of giddiness, nausea, and slight mental confusion, are not uncommon, following a blow upon the unprotected head, but these symptoms pass of!' in a few moments and the patient is able to continue the game without

-21-

experiencing any further effects from his injury. Severer grades of concussion are occasionally seen in which the symptoms persist for a few hours, but are never attended by any serious after-effects. The patient should be given a brisk purge and put to bed in a darkened, quiet room for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. He can resume playing two or three days later provided he takes the precaution to wear a sole-leather skull-cap during the game.

A common injury, especially among players who are not in good physical condition, is a mild form of shock resulting from a blow over the abdomen, which affects the sensory nerves of the abdominal wall and viscera and produces a reflex disturbance of the circulation of the vasomotor system. The patient feels gidded and nauseated, falls to the ground, and experiences a sensation of air-hunger. His skin and mucous membranes are pale, breathing is irregular, pulse weak, and there may be slight irregularity of the heart’s action. Treatment consists in keeping the patient in the supine position with the head low for a few moments until the symptoms pass off and he is able to go on with the game.

Sprains rank next to contusions in their of frequency. They most commonly affect the ankle, knee, elbow, and acromio-clavicular joints, and the small joints of the thumb and fingers. Upon the receipt of a sprain the joint should be placed in hot water or have hot compresses applied for one hour, after which continuous pressure is applied by means of adhesive straps or a rubber bandage; an ice-cap is kept over this dressing, and the joint is kept elevated for twelve to twenty-four hours in order to limit the formation of an exudate in or around the joint. At the end of twenty-four hours the ice-cap is removed; either hot fomentation or applications of super-heated air are employed for one hour once or twice daily, and this is followed by massage and passive motion of the joint to hasten the absorbtion of any exudate which may have formed. Except in the case of unusually severe sprains active movements of the joint when properly supported are beneficial, and the patient should be encouraged after the first twenty-four hours to take exercise up to a point just short of aggravating his condition. When there is much effusion in the joint the limb should be kept elevated, and active motion of the joint suspended until the effusion has subsided.

Sprains of the small joints of the thumb and fingers are caused by overextension, arc usually very painful and apt to be followed by more or less permanent deformity in or around the joint, but they do not necessitate the patient’s retiring from the game. A sprained joint of the finger is best protected during the game by splinting it into a neighboring finger by means of adhesive plaster. A limited amount of motion in the joint can be preserved by passing the adhesive stips around the fingers above and below the joint, but not directly over it. Sprains of the thumb are protected by splinting the thupib to the radical side of the hand and index-finger.

Sprains of the wrist are very rare and usually not serious. They may be caused by either overextension or overflexion from falls upon the hand. Before returning to the game, the wrist should be supported

-22-

by strips of adhesive plaster applied around the hand and the lower end of the radius and ulna in the form of a figure-of-eight, with the strips crossing over the dorsum of the wrist for sprains of the dorsal ligaments, and over the palmar surface of the wrist for sprains of the anterior ligaments.

Sprains of the elbow generally affect the anterior ligaments of the joint, and as a rule prove obstinate to treatment. After the first few days the pain is not very acute and the joint can be used with comparative freedom, but the inability to supply' any form of support to the elbow which will not insurmountably handicap the player, and will at the same time protect the affected ligaments against the strains to which they are subjected, requires the patient’s absence from the game for day's or even weeks. This injury is not often followed by permanent disability, but any attempt at playing before the joint has fully recovered is sure to aggravate the condition and prolong convalescence.

Sprains and subluxations of the acromio-clavicular joint are fairly common, and during the acute stage are very crippling, so that the patient is unable to take part in the games. The treatment which proves of grtatest comfort to the patient consists at first in the firm application of a wide strip of adhesive plaster which begins at a point over the upper end of the sternum and extends upward and outward over the outer third of the clavicle, thence downward along the posterior surface of the arm, around the point of the flexed elbow, up the outer anterior surface of the arm. over the shoulder and across the clavicle, to end over the body' of the scapula. A slit should be cut in the plaster at the point where it passes over the olecranon, and the elbow further protected from pressure by placing a small pad of lint between it and the plaster. This dressing supports the weight of the arm and fixes the bones forming the joint in position. It does not interfere with the giving of massage, nor the application of such sedatives as lead water and laudanum or aqueous solutions of ichthyol. In order to still further relieve the dragging weight of the arm on the joint a Velpeau bandage should be applied. When the acute symptoms begin to subside the arm should be released from this dressing and the shoulder should be encased with diagonally placed strips of adhesive plaster which have a common point of crossing over the joint which they are intended to support. In applying these strips of the plaster which extend from the root of the neck down over the deltoid muscle the arm should be held at an angle of 45° from the body, so that the adhesive strips will tend to support the weight of the arm when it is allowed to fall to the side of the chest. Dressings of this kind should be continued until the joint has fully recovered. Light exercise should be commenced as soon as it can be borne. Protection of the joint during the game is secured by means of a large saddle-shaped, sole-leather pad which completely covers the shoulder and has points of pressure over the anterior and posterior aspects of the chest.

Among football players the ankle is sprained more frequently than any' of the other large joints. The injury commonlv affects either the internal or external ligaments and is usually accompanied by consider-

—23—

able swelling. In addition to receiving the treatment applicable to all-sprains, the ankle should be firmly encased with strips of adhesive plaster three-quarters of an inch in width. In applying the first strip of plaster its middle is placed under the heel and its ends are brought up vertically oyer the lateral aspects of the joints along the inner and outer borders of the tendo Achillis, to end at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the leg. The second strip is applied at a right angle to the first, by having its middle placed over the insertion of the tendo Achillis and its ends brought forward horizontally along the lateral aspects of the joints. Additional strips of plaster, alternating between the horizontal and the vertical direction, and each one overlapping its predecessor by one-half its width, are then applied in sufficient number to completely enclose the ankle. The vertical strips prevent eversion and inversion of the foot, while the horizontal strips exert pressure on the joint, help limit motion, and fix the vertical strips. A third layer of transverse strips can be applied from below upward if it seems desirable to secure additional support. By means of this dressing an ankle which is otherwise too sensitive to permit of the foot being touched to the ground can be so firmly supported that walking or even running does not produce much discomfort. The patient should continue to wear this dressing, as well as a firm leather anklet over it until the joint returns to normal.

The internal lateral ligament is usually involved in sprains of the knee-joint. Only a little pain is experienced at the time the injury is received, but an inflammatory reaction occurs within a few hours when all movements of the joint are extremely painful and a localized area of exquisite tenderness about the size of a five-cent piece is present at the tibial attachment of the ligament. This injury is rebellious to treatment and exceptionally results in a slight permanent disability of the joint. Diagonal and transverse strips of adhesive plaster covering in the anterior and lateral aspects of the knee afford some support and should be applied before the patient begins to exercise, but they do not protect the joint from a repetition of the injury. An apparatus which is rather cumbersome, but which will accomplish the latter purpose, consists of a padded metal brace with a joint which permits of flexion and extension of the knee, but which resists any lateral motion. The brace is attached to the inner side of the joint by means of wide canvas bands which are laced firmly around the calf and the lower portion of the thigh. The force of a blow applied to the outer side of the knee is expended upon the brace and does not affect the internal lateral ligament.

Dislocation of the semilunar cartilages is another not uncommon affection of the knee-joint. It is caused by a lateral twisting or rotation of the knee when in a position of flexion, and usually involves the inner cartilage. Either the cartilage itself or its ligamentous attachment is torn; the cartilage slips out of place and becomes pinched between the tibia and femur. At the time of the accident the patient falls to the ground, suffers intense pain, the knee is knocked in semiflexion and the edge of the cartilage can sometimes be felt in its abnormal position in front of the joint. Reduction of the cartilage is accomplished bv sharp

-24-

flexion of the knee, combined with either inward rotation of the leg or lateral rocking of the joint. The inflammatory reaction in the knee-joint which follows a dislocation of the semilunar cartilage for the first time must be treated by rest, pressure, elevation, and the application ol sedative lotions. The tendency toward recurrence of the dislocation is greatly diminished by using the knee-brace above described, or by exerting moderate pressure upon the joint by means of a rubber bandage. Dislocation of the semilunar cartilage sometimes tends to recur even after the patient has given up football, but the inflammatory symptoms following the subsequent dislocations are usually mild in nature, and the patient soon learns the knack of replacing the cartilage himself. The disability which sometimes results from this injury can be overcome and perfect function of the joint secured by exercising the affected cartilage.

The same forms of violence which cause sprains, if sufficiently severe, may cause dislocations.

Dislocations most commonly affect the interphalangeal joints of the fingers and the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb. These injuries are very painful, but after reduction of the dislocation and splinting of the finger to its neighbor or the thumb to the side of the hand, the patient is able to go on with the game.

Dislocations affect the elbow more frequentlv than any other of the large joints. Dislocation of the shoulder is comparatively rare. These injuries require a month’s absence from the game and are prone to be followed by a permanent weakened joint.

One player who came under my observation had a forward dislocation of the manubrium on the gladiolus which he had received two years previous, probably as the result of direct violence. The deformity was still present, but it did not occasion any disability.

Fracture of the nasal bones is a very common injury resulting from striking the nose against the head of another player. Unless hemorrhage is too severe, the patient may be permitted to finish the game in which he is engaged after having been provided with a nose-guard. The fragments should be replaced by any of the customary methods, and any subsequent displacement during play can be prevented bv the use of the nose-guard.

Fractures of the clavicle rank next in order and are generally situated in the outer half af the bone. Owing to the great musclar development of these patients it is usually impossible during the period of muscular spasm to hold the fragments in position by any form of ambulatory dressing. The patient should therefore be put to bed on a firm, flat mattress, with one or two pillows under the head and the forearm flexed across the chest until the muscels relax, when the Sayre dressing for fracture of the clavicle should be applied. The patient should not attempt to resume play for a full month, and then a saddle-shaped leather shield should be fitted over the shoulder.

I have never seen a Colles fracture as the result of a football injury, but in one case which I saw the player sustained a fracture near the middle of the shaft of the radius from swinging his forearm violently across the great trochanter of another player.
Fracture of the metacarpal bones may result from indirect violence incident to blows upon the proximal knuckle or from direct violence as that inflicted by the cleats of another players shoe. After three weeks’ retirement from the game and treatment of the fracture on a Bond splint the patient may be permitted to play, the site of fracture being supported with pads of lint and the hand enclosed in a firm adhesive plaster dressing.

Fracture of the phalanges rarely result from direct violence and occasion but slight difficulty if the fragments are held in place by a properly fitting brace made of metal and leather which is attached to the wrist and extends over the dorsum of the hand to encircle the affected thumb or finger.

Fractures of the hips and dislocations of the costal cartilages are occasionallv seen as the result of direct violence from kicks or blows. After having the affected side of the chest tirmly strapped with broad strips of adhesive plaster and a felt-padded leather shield carefully secured over the injured area the patient is enabled to resume playing.

A fracture of any of the bones of the lower extremity as the result of football has never come under my observation.

Small lacerated, contused, or incised wounds are very common among football players. Wounds of the hands usually result from being trampled upon. Contused wounds of the nose and chin and incised, slightly contused wounds over the supraorbital crest are caused by blows over the head by another player. Lacerated wounds of the inner surfaces of the lips and cheeks are caused by blows over the teeth. Laceration of the ear along its line of attachment to the scalp is usually produced by the player attempting to force his head through a narrow opening between two other players. Blisters over the heels are infrequently produced by poorly fitting shoes. The injuries, while not serious in themselves, should be treated under the strictest antiseptic precautions in order to prevent an infection from the mud and dirt of the football field.

Teno-synovitis of the tendo Achillis is occasionally seen among football players as the result of severe strains on this tendon. All efforts of walking are painful, some swelling is present over the tendon and the charateristic crepitation is obtained by palpation. Strains on the tendon are prevented by placing the foot in extreme extension and applying strips of adhesive plaster which begin at the junction of the middle and the lower third of the leg and run in a diagonal direction alternately around the outer and inner surfaces of the os calcis to end below the heel. By applying a second layer of adhesive strips around the ankle and' lower portion of the leg pressure is exerted over the affected tendon, pain is relieved, and the condition is speedily cured.

Appendicitis resulting from football injuries has been extremely rare in my own experience. I have seen but two cases of appendicitis in players during the football season and in both cases there was considerable doubt as to the affection having been traumatic in origin.
