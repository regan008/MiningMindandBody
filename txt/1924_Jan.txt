THE PHILOSOPHY OF A SUPERVISOR,*

By Jennie D. Pullen.

Editor’s Note—Since 1877 Miss Pullen, as teacher and supervisor, served the Cleveland schools. She resigned as supervisor last June. Shortly before terminating her official connection with the schools she was invited to give to the superintendent’s staff outstanding thoughts in her philosophy of education. This article is taken from her talk before the Btaff.

It is a great day in this city when our Public Schools open in September and our boys and girls go marching in—tens of thousands of them. I sometimes think the first day of school is a greater day than a national holiday because it is so vital a day in every home where there are children.

Children face a new year’s work—under new conditions, a new course, new books, new room, and most vital thing of all, the new

teacher under whose influence they are to be changed, to be given good habits or bad habits, to be helped or hindered in growth, to grow in power or to grow in stupidity.

The teacher is measuring the children as to their power and fitness and making her judgment of them. The children are busy too, measuring their teacher and deciding whether they will like ho* or not.

What a happy thing when the teacher at once wins the confidence and good will of her pupils. Happy are the children when teacher has tact, courtesy and some sense of humor and sympathy with young life.

There is no place in the world where the manners of a gentleman or lady count more than in the school room. All the arts of good breeding are not too much to spend to win the heart and open the minds of children.

A teacher’s name is in all the homes that first night; mothers and fathers are eager to know how the day has gone and what the prospect is. For to the teacher each pupil is a child, but in some home he is my child. He may be dull or alert, commonplace or Interesting, colorless or vivid, but he is to his parents their dearest possession. What the fathers and mothers think of a teacher should be of great concern to her.

It is a wise teacher who begins to show parents that she is working with them for the best interests of their boys and girls.

To be genuinely interested in child life is an asset.

I once heard William James address a body of students on “the personality of the teacher” and its quickening power. He recounted his own experience when he went to Harvard for entrance exams. The boys filed into a long room; on each side at intervals were little tables and at each table sat a professor with a vacant chair opposite. Each boy sat down opposite one of his future teachers. After an oral quiz of ten minutes a bell rang and the boys moved forward to the next table where sat his next examiner.

Mr. James said that at one table he sat opposite Mr. 0. W. Holmes for his test in physiology. He was asked to tell briefly about the circulation of the blood; in three minutes it was done, and pronounced good. In the other seven minutes, to his astonishment, lie was questioned about his home, his father and mother, the things he liked best, his plans and ambitions.

After that he said Mr. Holmes spoke a few friendly and inspiring words that he had never forgotten and he went away with glowing heart because this man had shown such interest in him.

It always pays when a teacher gives children the impression that she is their friend as well as their teacher.

Some people do it with such ease. A principal standing in the hall as her boys passed her said to a tall, athletic sixth grader, “Aren't you glad we won Harry, and don't you hope we’ll keep first place?”

“Sure I do,” said Harry, his face beaming upon her.

Then the principal turned to a little boy who was passing. "Oh, Billy, how’s the new little sister?”

‘‘Oh, she’s dandy—Mother lets me hold her now!”

There is something in getting in back of the lessons and touching the life interests of boys and girls that is well worth while.

The relation of the supervisor to all with whom she workB should have this same element of confidence that gives the idea that she is a friend and helper, not a commander; that all are working together for the benefit of boys and girls.

The members of the superintendent's staff have laid upon them the responsibility of helping people to grow better in their work. What do we consider the most important single element in helping teachers to grow better in their work?

Teachers, as children, need most a friend in those who guide them. Sometimes they need our reassurance when down-hearted; we can say the word often that helps a teacher not to lose faith in herself.

It is a spiritual tonic to a teacher to know that some one in authority over her believes that she is in earnest in her work and is striving to do her best.

It is also true that one is a teacher’s best friend and helper when words are spoken that do not gloss over things, but show that she needs greater severity with herself; that she must demand better effort from herself, before she can demand it from her pupils.

In these days the men and women who go out from the office are not the only supervisors. Every principal is considered the supervisor of the building of which she is in charge and is in a measure responsible for the kind of work that goes on in it.

In different degrees our principals make themselves responsible for changing the quality of instruction in their buildings and lifting it to better standards. Long ago principals were concerned only with the executive affairs of the building and with the conduct of children in the halls and school yard. Later it became the duty of principals to study the work of the grades; to know the principles underlying the presentation of lessons and to be able to judge methods in use in their buildings. Principals began to take courses in supervision and in methods of teaching.

DANISH GYMNASTS AT THE UNIVERSITY.

Niels Bukh and his pupils, who have been touring America Since September 18, appeared at the University of Cincinnati on Friday, October 26, and gave the physical-education loving public of this vicinity an opportunity to view the highly acclaimed work of this noted educator. Gym class was called off for the evening and a number of our Actives and Ladies were more than glad to see what the famous Dane had to show. The spacious University *

gymnasium was crowded to capacity and the audience greeted the blue clad athletes enthusiastically when they made their appearance in a column of twos singing a song that sounded like a funeral dirge. They certainly would have been outdistanced if our Gym crowd had struck up, “We’re Loyal to You.’’

Bukh calls his method "Primitive and Rhythmic Gymnastics.” The first division is the one which has been most revolutionary. He believes that many of the muscles and functions of primitive man have become atrophied because of our modern manner of life and that the prevailing weakness of the race can be traced to their neglect. His "Primitive Gymnastics ' are designed to call into use again all of the neglected elements of the body. After the muscles have been limbered up, they are strengthened, according to his system, and the final step in the training is the subordination of the muscles to the commands of the mind.

"Rhythmic Gymnastics” are then indulged in for their beauty and attraction to young people. According to one of his followers, "he has re-discovered the secret of the Greeks; how to create spontaneity and the play spirit, which is lacking from the modem systems of physical education. He has made physical education a delightful game of self-expression.”

It is in this instance that the exhibition proved most disappointing. Instead of seeing self-expression, beautiful and joyous execution, spontaneity of action and natural, rhythmic gymnastics, we saw little that resembled it. If the Swedish and German systems are formal, then the Danish is ultra-formal. The “Primitive Gymnastics” were performed by the men and really amounted to a thoro setting-up drill. These exercises called for unparalleled contortions ana were very strenuous. They seemed to be perfectly committed to memory and were done without music or count, altho by watching the lips of the performers one could see that each man was counting for himself. Some of the exercises called for high coordination and showed an immense amount of practice.

The women performed similar exercises altho less strenuous. They worked in a column of threes in divided order and in circle formation. Most of the exercises were pretty to look upon. Some were done to song but this seemed a violation of hygienic laws since it is almost impossible to sing and execute forceful contractions at the same time.

The third part of the program consisted of buck and horse exercises and tumbling by the men. Hand stands were their forte on the apparatus and the tumbling consisted of round-offs, front and back hand springs and back flips. This was the spectacular part of the exhibition and drew much applause from the audience. It compared well with a circus performance but failed to come anywhere near apparatus work as we know it.

The concluding number was made up entirely of folk dances. The costuming was quaint and the dances of Danish origin. They

Digitized by v^ooQle
345

were nothing more than the ordinary folk dances that we see every day in our gymnasiums only we differ from them in that we dance the folk dances of all nations instead of just one.

From the performer’s point of view the lesson was devoid of joy. The only pleasure that they seemed to experience came during the folk dancing. No games were shown, so we take it that they are not included in Bukn’s system.

The main objection to the Danish idea of physical education as we see it, is that it is too stiff and formal and that it does not permit of enough self-expression and enjoyment. We could not expect the American youth of today to “hold his nose to the grindstone’’ as the Danes must certainly do and go thru such vigorous work without cracking a smile for fear of exercising only thirteen facial muscles instead of the sixty-four that are used in frowning. How the authorities at the University, who are so strongly in favor of informal gymnastics, can advocate such a system and how they can say that “since the Cincinnati public schools use a system of physical education which is based on the German methods, while Bukh uses a system that is directly opposed to it, the performance should arouse much criticism’’ is beyond our meagre powers of comprehension.

Bukh has shown us nothing, new. In fact, we have been doing all that he presented in his system, and then some, the only difference being that we do not go to extremes as he does in some of the work. The Danish methods cannot supplant anything that we have in America at the present time and offer us little to profit by.

In presenting the gymnasts the speaker of the evening explained that all of the performers were amateurs being picked up at random from the college groups, and that they had but one hour's training a day for five months. We were forced to take this announcement with a grain of sodium chloride for it was very evident that they were highly trained and that they had been working a long long time on some of the things that we saw. The average age for Doth men and women was well over thirty years and it might be of interest to note that all of the women were married.

We must, however, give Bukh credit for “getting by.” If he is asked to fool the public and does it, he is not to blame. The American public wants to be fooled and will flock to see anyone who has a foreign name. Bukh’s methods will influence physical education very little. We’ll stick to what we've got until something better is produced.

SOME OF THE CAUSAL FACTORS IN THE INCREASED HEIGHT OF COLLEGE WOMEN.

By Clelia Duel Mosher, M. D., Associate Professor of Personal Hygiene and Medical Adviser of Women, Stanford University, Calif.

College women during the last three decades have increased in size. The studies* * made at Stanford University of 4,170 women students who entered during a period of thirty years show at the time of admission not only an increase in weight but also an increase of 1.2 inches in average height. These results have been confirmed by the Vassar College staHsticst based on the examinations of 7.064 women during thirty-seven years, an investigation which snows an increase in height "well over 1.5 inches;” and also by Smith College measurementstt of 10,149 women during a peiiod of twenty-two years.

Table 1 gives the data concerning height for Stanford University, Vassar College and Smith College individually in year groups, with the number of oases, and the average height for each year, and also shows the same data for 21,383 women, tne combined examinations from the three institutions.

Table 2 gives the same data for Stanford women by decades.

Consideration of the average height of college women either separately in terms of the individual college and university group, or in terms of the measurements of the 21,383 examinations of women from Stanford, Vassar and Smith combined, shows the same increase (Table 1). We may therefore conclude that college women have increased in average height 1.2 inches or more in the last thirty years.

A careful study of the 4,170 women who entered Stanford University during the last three decades shows that while the range in height has remained about the same (14 inches), there has been an increasing number of women in the upper end of the series; or, in other words, while there are women coming to the university just as short in height as during the first decade, their number is decreasing, while at the same tune the number of tall girls is increasing. Not every woman has gained in height 1.2 inches, but an increasing number of women who are tall are entering the university.

Explanations for Increased Height of Women.

Is the increase in height during these later years due to the greater admixture of the northern races through immigration? This does not appear to be the case.

The arguments against this are several. First, this increase in height is found in a western university and in two eastern colleges. There is a greater increase in the Vassar height than in the height of the Stanford women. Although the Smith records show a somewhat smaller average increase, yet these records extend over twenty-two years, only a little more than the last two decades, and at both Stanford and Vassar the increase in average height is greater from the first to the second decade than from the second decade to the

third. Moreover, the study of the birthplaces of the Stanford women shows that these women are a cross section of the college women of the United States and not a localized group (Table 3). Every state in the Union, with the exception of North Carolina and Delaware, is represented, only about 37 per cent being from California. There are 135 from the New England states and 127 from Oregon and Washington; 248 from the Middle Atlantic states, as contrasted with 297 from the Mountain states; the Southern states show a smaller attendance in college—the South Atlantic having forty-three, and the East South Central forty-six, together having eighty-nine representatives at Stanford, as contrasted with the West South Central states, with seventy-four daughters in the university; the East North Central states, which have 695 students, are not far away from the West North Central states, which have 703 students, only eight more than in the previous division. Again, may not the question be raised whether the daughters of parents bom in other countries are able to go to college in any very, great numbers in the first generation? The answer seems to be in the negative; certainly they do not go in sufficient proportion to influence the height in a consideration of 21,383 women who are represented in this study.

It is therefore evident that we must seek some other explanation for the increased height of women than either a greater percentage of the northern races due to immigration, or the presence of westerners who are known to be on the average somewhat taller than eastern people.

It is quite true that the average height of California women is slightly greater than the height of non-California women, as shown

in Table 4. But the inclusion of a greater number of Californians in the later decades will not account for the increase in height, for it will be noted that the non-Californians increased in height to a much greater extent than did the Californians. That the non-Californians have shown a greater increase in height than have the Californians is an indirect proof of the contention that exercise and more hygienic clothing are among the causal factors in the development of this finer physical type of woman. The outdoor life with its tramping, climbing, riding and exercise in the open was common to women to a much greater degree in California in the first decade than in the eastern United States. Certainly bicycling, which was one of the chief forms of athletics in the first decade, was almost universal at Stanford, where the limited means of transportation made it an essential to every-day living during those pioneer days. With bicycling came the necessity for shorter, lighter and looser clothing. It became imperative to discard the voluminous darts measuring from 9 to 15 feet in diameter, which often weighed as much as 7 pounds, and thus here and there some venturesome

In my first paper, “Concerning the Size of Women,"* it was stated after a general survey of all the vailable data that two great factors are concerned in these results: (1) the change in fashion, making possible the wearing of clothing which interferes less with the hygiene of the woman (2) the increased physical activity, which

has been brought about by the (a) change in dress; (b) development of physical training and sports in the secondary schools as well as in our colleges, and (c) change in the conventional attitude toward these activities for women.

Increased Physical Activity of Women.	.

Let us consider, first, the increased physical activity of women It is a matter of common knowledge that the modern college gir I is more physically active than the women of thirty years ago, but the Vassar studies make a real contribution to this subject. From 1896 to 1900, 26.5 per cent of the entering students at Vassar College had engaged in no form of sport before coming to college; from 1916 to 1920, only 0.6 per cent reported no sports before admission to the college. This almost universal physical activity during the preparatory years has been fostered, not only by the laws for compulsory physical training in the secondary schools, but also by the municipal play grounds and swimming pools. This eagerly to be desired, more fully developed woman will, therefore, be found in constantly increasing numbers among all classes of women, those who go to college and those who do not go, thus insuring better wives and mothers, and consequently a better race.

Influence of Fashion.

The other factor is the influence of fashion. It has already been noted that, with increasing physical activity, a change to lighter and looser clothing was made and fashion was forced to adapt itself to the introduction of the bicycle and automobile. The changes in fashion have been studied by A. L. Kroeber, the anthropologist, who has traced these variations over a period of more than sixty years. His figures for twenty-nine years of the period covered by the Stanford measurements have been plotted in curves. The ratios given for the width of skirt, the length of skirt, and the width of waist throw some light on the problem of the relation of change in fashion to increased height and functional disability, as shown by the Stanford studies on these two subjects.

The detailed curves after Kroeber are given, and also the average curve, which shows even more clearly the gradual narrowing and shortening of the skirt and at the same time the increased breadth of waist.

In any consideration of the advantages to the health of women in the narrowing and shortening of the skirt, we must bear in mind that I am not referring to such vagaries of fashion as are represented in the detailed curve for the year 1911, and again in 1920, developments which would be just as hampering to freedom of motion as were the heavy, voluminous skirts, although the excessive narrow-

b€8b was compensated for in part, at least, by an equally and unduly excessive shortening. These very extreme styles were of relatively short duration and therefore of minor significance. The trend of the curve, when studied in connection with the Stanford curves for periodic disability and height, shows an unmistakable parallel.

Reliable data on the 'menstrual conditions of the women at Stanford were available only for the years 1893, 1894, 1896, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1916 and 1917. In an earlier paper I discussed the unreliability of general statements about the menstrual function as collected from the women concerning themselves. The records for the years mentioned I can personally vouch for as being as reliable as single statements can be made. No case in which there was pain has been overlooked. The close relation between these changes in fashion and the relief from menstrual pain is obvious. This relation has been repeatedly shown in my clinical experience, but lack of space prevents the citing of cases. The evil effect of heavy clothing is also reflected in the percentage of pain at the menstrual period, as shown in the Stanford no dysmenorrhea curve, which from 1911 to 1917 steadily rises, until in 1916 and 1916

it shows that 68 per cent of the women were free from pain at the time of menstruation—a great contrast to 1894, when there were but 19 per cent who did not suffer pain at their menstrual periods.

The Vassar investigation in regard to the girth of waist is shown in' Table 5. It will be noted that there was a steady decrease in the girth of waist up to 1904, and a steady increase from 1904 to the present time. This is readily explained by the study of Dr. Rroeber's curve for breadth of waist given in the accompanying

chart. As breadth of waist is a fair indicator of the degree of compression, it is not surprising that the demand of fashion for a small waist should be evident in the ratio of less than 0.5 up to 1904, while as this demand gradually lessened, the ratio changed to 3.5 from 1905 to 1919. The ratios should be correlated with a decreasing girth of waist as a result of continuous compression over a period of years. When the demand of fashion for a small waist finally ceased, the increase in width of waist occurred, as shown in the curve from 1904 to 1921. To this is related the increase previously considered in the number of women who do not suffer pain at menstruation.

Relation of Change in Fashion to Increased Height.

How is this change in fashion, which permits more normal functioning and greater freedom cf exercise, related to increased height?

One of the serious problems in regard to college girls during the early days was how to induce these delicate, undeveloped women to eat enough nourishing food. The girl of this first decade lacked appetite. The vigorous modem girl, physically fit, eats in season and out, and is as hard to satisfy as a growing boy—and for the same reason: the body is working normally and needs more food for growth and development. Here we find a reasonable explanation of the fact that the woman not only functions more perfectly, but weighs more and is growing taller, while, as was demonstrated in 1917, the difference in muscular strength between men and women is due to the difference in use of muscles and not to sex.

This more fully developed and more perfectly functioning woman is well fitted for motherhood, while her desire for children is shown by the fact that she no sooner comes out from under the anesthetic at one labor than she begins to plan for the coming of her next baby.

In this age, when questions of population and the falling birth rate are of such vital import, it behooves us to give attention to every factor that has any bearing on this subject.

It is time that we ceased thinking in terms of the unfitnessand weakness of women. This splendid modem woman, grown taller and more vigorous because, freed from restricting fashions of dress, she exercises more and consequently eats more, has become better fitted to be the mother of finer sons and daughters, the promise of a stronger race.

TESTS FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS.

By William A. Steelier.

From a teacher, who has just returned from a trip to Europe, I received a copy of regulations governing the winning of a badge certifying the accomplishment of definite physical tests.

It appears that in Germany a National Committee for Physical Education (Deutscher Reichsausschuss fuer Leibesuebungen) is fostering a test for physical fitness that is intended to act as an inducement for men and women over 18 years of age to strive for physical f itness betterment. The accomplishment of work prescribed try the National Committee leads to the granting of a bronze, silver, or gold badge.

The rules and regulations governing attempts to win the badge (based on the revisions of May 28,1921) are as follows:

1.	The National Committee on Physical Education grants the “German Badge for Physical Fitness” (Deutsches Turn- und Sport-abzeichen) as a public recognition for all-around physical ability.

2.	The badge represents a five fold accomplishment. It is a certificate of definite achievement in events demanding sound heart and lungs, energy, efficient body control, speed and endurance.

3.	The aim of the badge is to give an incentive:

a)	for striving toward a high all around muscular development necessary for attaining one’s highest potential powers;

b)	for striving to retain bodily perfection until old age.

4.	Any German, over 18 years of age, may try for the badge.

6.	There are three classes of badges, a) bronze, b) silver, c) gold.

a)	To win the bronze badge a person must pass the five required events within 12 months.

b)	To win the silver badge a person in possession of the bronze badge must again pass the five required events during eight years. These need not be successive years.

The silver badge may also be won by a person over 82 years of age passing the required five events.

c)	To win the gold badge a person in possession of the silver badge during eight more years must again pass the required five •vents.

The gold badge may also be won by a person over 40 yeans of age passing the required five events.

6.	The prescril*ed events are contained in the following five groups of athletic endeavor. Group 1 has only one event which must be passed by all entrants. In the other groups the entrant may select any one event.

7.	Every entrant, for a nominal sum, receives from the National Committee a folder containing rules governing the competitions. This folder has a place for the contestant’s photograph, and torthe certification of each event, attested by not less than two judges from the organizations empowered to conduct tests.

8.	Every entrant, upon approval of the society, club, etc., to which he belongs, sends his folder (showing exactly what his accomplishment was in one event in each prescribed group) to the National Committee. This committee, after a verification of the records, grants the badge and a certificate.

POSTURE AND INDUSTRIAL SEATING.*

By Nelle Swartz, Director Bureau of Women In Industry, Department of

Labor, New York.

A prominent industrial engineer is quoted as saying that the average factory chair always reminds him of the time-worn story of ■ the coffin: "The man who made it didn’t want it; the man who bought it didn't use it, and the man who used it didn’t have anything to say about it.’’

Note—Read at the annual meeting of the American Posture League.

Hitherto the principal aim in producing seats for factories or stores seems to have been to produce a chair that was unbreakable rather than one that was correct from the physiological point of view. A trip through the average- plant is almost sure to disclose startling novelties in the wav of seating arrangements. Twenty different kinds of chairs may be gathered from the same plant, no one of them a really satisfactory seat. They have been purchased at different times by different people for use at different processes, but the only considerations have in all probability been cheapness, durability and free aisle space. As a result of tnis in many cases improvements have been attempted by the workers; backs have been put on or knocked off, arms or cushions havebeen added, abox or barrel has been made into a seat, a chair seat has been raised by using a book or strip of wood, or the particularly ingenious workman has built out a seat from some part of his machine.

The difficulty seems to be not only that very little thought has been given the question of industrial posture but also in many instances the impossibility of scrapping old equipment, constructed with no regard for the breaking back or the dangling legs of the tired workman.

However, it is fortunately coming to be true that manufacturers are beginning to realize that a correct position at work saves energy units and means increased efficiency in production. Consequently they are beginning to demand a chair for their workers which has been constructed with some knowledge of physiology in addition to its unbreakable features. The possibility for good posture at work has not been assured, however, when a good chair is secured. The relation of the different parts of the work place—the bench, chair, foot rest, place for supplies and the place for finished work—must be considered; the chair may be too high or too low for the work bench or machine; a brace or set of drawers may prevent a proper position of the worker’s feet and legs.

The management of a large plant recently decided to replace round top stools in one department with chairs which had been highly recommended; these chairs were pointed out to a visitor with great pride, yet the workers were all standing. It turned out that the work bench measured thirty-one inches from the floor, while the chairs were twenty-eight inches high; it was an impossibility for the workers to get their knees between the chair and the bench and the result was that these superior seats were never used.

The Division of Women in Industry of the New York State Department of Labor, dining the last winter of 1921, in response to many requests from manufacturers, studied the question of Industrial Posture and Seating. In publishing the results of this study, the Division makes no pretense of saying the final word, for like many details of industrial management much more is still unknown than is known. Starting with the concrete idea of collecting the best possible designs for chairs for industrial workers, the Division soon realized the problem in reality was the question of eliminating, in so far as possible, the fatigue which comes from bad posture, or from continuously working in one position.
360

Lack of imagination is responsible for much bad seating; custom has decreed the way in which many operations are performed.

The conclusions and recommendations of the study of the Division are briefly:

First: That posture should be varied, and, Second: that work conditions should be such that correct posture is made possible.

Continuous standing and continuous sitting are both harmful and for this reason the importance of variation in posture cannot be too strongly emphasized. While there has been a great deal of testimony from physicians of all countries as to the harmful effects of long hours of standing on women workers, varicose veins, flat feet and knock knees are frequently found among men—pressers, apprentices in bakeries and motormen and conductors; and it is becoming more and more true that the demands of the particular operation must be considered more than the sex of the worker. Conditions should be such as to allow the worker to vary his position at will, because of the rest and the enormous saving of energy which come from change of position during working hours.

In one of the larger collar manufacturing plants in New York State, where about four hundred girls were sorting collars—veiy tedious, monotonous work—there was a small extra folding table top at each girl’s place of work, so that die could push her chair back, open up the folding top and stand to do her sorting. When one enters this department about fifty per cent of the girls are sitting and fifty per cent are standing and each girl can vary her position as she wishes, and still be in the same relation to her work.

The most usual method of making it possible for work positions to vary from sitting to standing and vice versa, is to raise the work bench to a standing height and use a high chair with a foot rest properly arranged.

When it is impossible to vary the worker’s position while at work, either because equipment and machines have been constructed with no thought of allowing variation, or because the operation is one at which only one position is possible, other means have been found to enable the change to be made. One such means is having an interchange of processes so that workers change at regular intervals, not only their position but their work. In a large ribbon mill in New York State for example, one department which did “blocking” in a standing position interchanged every two hours with another department which did "spinning,” a process requiring a sitting position.

Another means used is the regulation of handling supplies so that the worker is forced to rise from that operation at which she has been sitting and take the finished article to another department. Thus of necessity operators rise, walk about and change their positions. A production engineer tells of one instance in a clothing factory where the workers on piece work never paused during rush home or rose from their chairs. Supplies were brought to them and on a long wall right behind them their wraps were hung; at noon they reached for their lunches, usually in their coat pockets and ate at their machines. In his re-organization of the plant he

861

removed the wraps to a distant part of the floor and regulated the supplies in such a way that the workers were obliged to rise and walk about. Instead of considering this a waste of time, it was definitely planned as a means of increasing production.

The most popular means employed to vary posture is the introduction of rest periods. The fundamental idea of the rest period is that through change of position, interest and energy are renewed and the worker is prevented from reaching a condition of overfatigue. Rest periods may be automatic, due to pauses inherent in the nature of the work, or may be compulsory, set by the management to be taken at a fixed time for a definite number of minutes, or the rest period may be taken at the discretion of the worker by permission of the management; the latter type of rest period, however, too often is not taken at all, especially if the worker is a piece worker. The workers frequently ask that compulsory rest periods be eliminated so that they may leave that much earlier at the end of the day. Such a plan, of course, in no way brings the same results, for the rest period should be planned scientifically to make a break in the work at a time when change is most needed.

The second recommendation made by the Division of Women in Industry is that work conditions should be such that correct posture is possible.

This means first, providing a physiologically good chair, and second, insuring the proper relationship between the different parts of the work place.

What the best chair is, depends in a large measure upon the type of work, the muscles most used, etc. This is particularly true as related to the height and depth of the chair. The chair should be broad, not too deep and slightly saddle shaped, with the front edge rounded; this front edge is often a source of trouble; if it extends too far under the knees the circulation is cut off; if the edge is left sharp and not rounded carefully this tends to cut off the circulation no matter what the depth of the seat may be.

The most satisfactory material for a chair seat is wood. Cane seats are apt to become saggy and metal seats are too hard, or are made with sharp edges which cut off the circulation.

The type of back which is most satisfactory for a seat depends again on the nature of the work. Where constant lifting or reaching is involved, the back unless carefully constructed, may interfere with arm movements. The California Industrial Commission in approving seats for women workers in the canneries, chose one with a rectangular seat and no back. In general, backs are used by the workers and are recommended. Any chair which is to be used for rest, should of course have a back. The American Posture League recommends that there be an open space about seven inches from the seat floor before the back rest begins. This would enable workers to sit well back in the chair. Support should be given at the small of the back and the support itself should be at least two and one-half inches wide and slightly curved. Sharp edges should be avoided and the horizontal supports should be spaced so that

they do not pinch the worker by being too narrow or prevent the necessary space needed at the base of the chair by being too wide.

But it is not enough to provide even the best chair that can be made according to physiological standards. For the possibility for good posture, in sitting and standing depends in a large measure upon the proper	relatiiAship of the different parts of the work place.

This means again a study of the individual operation to be performed—the reach, the amount of pressure, the size and kind of supplies, the lunch space necessary, the height of the worker, etc.

Many states have attempted to standardize seating in industry by passing laws compelling manufacturers to supply seats for their workers; such a law was passed in New York State as early as 1881, and in 1920 forty-seven states had laws requiring seats in mercantile establishments; thirty-six states require seats in both mercantile and manufacturing establishments and some few require seats in practically all establishments. These laws as they stand offer little protection to health, because even when a sufficient number of seats are provided it is practically impossible to see that employees are allowed to use them. As far as industrial posture and seating is concerned we are still in the stage of experimentation. So little thought has been given to the problem of posture in industry that at the present time almost any plant can go far in improving conditions by even the rudest attempt to plan the work place so that a fair chance for minimum posture standards is given the worker.

As general conditions now exist, any posture at all is as good as the best, and of course bad, cramped postures become the natural and comfortable ones. According to the Gilbreth’s there is a “one best way” of doing eveiything and the time has come for us to see to it that workers are given a chance for the "one best posture” at work—both for the sake of health and for the sake of standards of workmanship.

Most of the attempts at good seating in industiy are obviously comprised between what has been and what might be; there are no absolute standards; the best we can do is to follow a few fundamental principles of good posture and refuse to accept with no regard for physical needs what custom has chanced to give us. Must a worker always endure a bench constructed too high or too low? Must a worker always use the conveniently bad chair? Must the housewife always accept the plumber’s insistence that a sink and wash tubs be built at a back breaking height? To take some slight step in the right direction is usually so simple that it seems foolish to suggest it, but some step, however simple, is that much better than no step at all, and we may eventually be able to have a commercial company’s advertisement read "A seat that never wears the worker out” rather than "A seat that never wears out.”

WHAT THE HEATING ENGINEERS’ RESEARCH LABORATORY IS DOING FOR THE INDUSTRY.

By F. Paul Anderson, Director.

Since the establishment of the Research Laboratory of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers there has been an increasing number of pieces of research work undertaken and completed. The laboratory is fortunately situated in the environment of the Bureau of Mines. The human element finds expression in mathematicians, physicists, chemists, draftsmen, tool and instrument makers, photographers and scientific observers of many varied talents. There is available almost every conceivable kind of energy and material.

The Bureau of Mines, through its large power plant, furnishes all sorts of electric current, compressed air, steam at any pressure and gas. The Research Laboratory has at its command facilities that would represent an expenditure of many thousands of dollars a year and the heating and ventilating fraternity should be under everlasting obligations to the officers of the Bureau of Mines who have made it possible to carry on this very effective co-operative work.

The present personnel of the laboratory, supported by the funds direct, are: Director F. Paul Anderson, Research Assistants, 0. W. Armspach, F. C. Houghten, P. Nicholls, C. P. Yaglaglou and M. Ingels. The clerical force of the office consists of a secretary and a stenographer.

With this small personnel we have the co-operation all the time of at least ten investigators from the Bureau of Mines, giving us at the present time a total of fifteen research assistants working on problems that pertain almost exclusively to the heating and ventilating art.

The laboratory’s facilities, including the psychometric room, are handsomely appointed for most careful research. In order to form an adequate conception of this center of scientific study, it is necessary for a person to perceive through his own eyes, processes employed in determining basic laws of permanent value to the engineering profession and especially to those persons concerned with heating and ventilating.

In addition to the work of the laboratory, there are in process in twenty universities of the country, lines of research work laid out in detail by the personnel of the Research Laboratory at Pittsburgh. There are at least forty men outside of the main laboratory who are seeking faithfully and diligently for some of the truths pertaining to the work of the heating and ventilating engineer. At the present time the following investigations are being carried on:

Temperature, Humidity and Air Motion Effects on Human Health and comfort.

The laboratory personnel is being assisted in this work by three physician scientists who have been assigned to the labora-

tory for this particular work by the Surgeon-General of the United States. The physiological changes taking place in the human body are being studied with more comprehensiveness than has ever been done in similar research. Within the next sixty days there will be some results obtained that will be of decided interest, not only to the engineer but to the medical fraternity in general. At toe present time twenty human subjects are observed in these investigations.

The Study of the Infiltration of Air in Buildings Is Being Carried on in Sixteen Universities.

In order to make the results comparative in all of these centers of study funder instructions that have been issued by the laboratory), many able scientists are finding out how air leaks in buildings of varied construction and type.

The Study of the Critical Velocities in the Various Elements Entering Into the Direct Radiation Steam Heating System.

In toe Fuel Section of the Bureau of Mines, there is in continuous operation apparatus affording every facility for the determination of absolute flow of steam and water thruout a wide range of temperature and pressure. Apparatus similar in character for determining critical velocity constants has been set up at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, the University of Kentucky andthe State College of Washington.

The Study of Heat Transmission and Combustion in House

Heating Boilers.

The Fuel Section of the Bureau of Mines is carrying on a very comprehensive series of investigations on existing types of boilers and on special arrangements with varied relation of heating surface and grate area in special forms of boilers. The object of this particular investigation is to finally present to engineering literature an ideal condition of combustion for every commercial fuel.

The Study of Present Methods and the Development of a New One For Measuring Dust.

This research problem involves not only the study of air washing but involves an absolute mode for measuring dust. The present methods of dust determination are inadequate. It is the purpose of the Laboratory, if possible, to develop an entirely new method for registering the relative amount of dust in any atmosphere.

The Study of the Value of Ozone in Ventilation.

The rapidly increasing use of ozone in ventilation has made it imperative that some authenticated effects of ozone in air purification be determined. This work is being carried on very largely by the chemists and physiologists of the Bureau of Mines and the United States Public Health Service in co-operation with the Research Laboratory of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers.

Heat Transmission Investigations.

A a recent meeting of the National Research Council to con-aider establishing a central committee for the work, we submitted

Digitized by L^ooQle
366

a survey of the existing data and present needs of this branch, and suggestions for future work which we believe would more quickly help the profession.

In our own laboratory we are undertaking the development of thermal transmission meters, as our facilities here permit of greater accuracy of work than is usually found. With the help of these instruments we will be able in the future to obtain transmission values from existing structures, a feat which is not now possible.

The Comparative Study of Different Types of Ventilating

Systems.

At the Whitney School in Minneapolis observations have been taken during the winter on five types of systems of ventilation. A committee from the laboratory at an early date will go to Minneapolis to make a survey, and if possible a report, on the particular points of merit of each system at the June meeting of the society.

The foregoing is a presentation of the research problems that are being conducted at the present time. Many other lines of investigations have been planned, but the personnel of the laboratory and the facilities do not make it possible to push more investigations at the present time. The laboratory is rapidly becoming a clearing house of information on subjects affecting the practical side of heating and ventilating engineering.

It is the purpose of the laboratory officials to stimulate the establishment of codes for testing commercial apparatus. The first step in this direction is a recent code formed by the National Association of Fan Manufacturers and the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers for the testing of centrifugal and propeller fans. Reports and papers will be presented on most of the problems mentioned above at the June (Buffalo-Detroit) meeting of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers.— Magazine.

HEALTH INSTRUCTION.

Every teacher specializes in some department of school work in the Ashland School in St. Louis, and certain teachers who are interested in the field of physical education have chosen to devote their time to health instruction and supervision of physical welfare.

There are seven periods in the school day, and each class from the second thru the eighth grade has one period of 45 minutes for physical education for each of the five school days in the week. The school is provided with basement playrooms and large outdoor playgrounds. The boys and girls are separated for this work and have separate playrooms and outdoor playgrounds.

In the physical education activities as in the other educa-tional activities three boys and girls are selected by the class and teacher as team captains. These leaders are chosen for their personality and efficiency in the subject in hand. They hold office for one term of 20 weeks. The remaining members of the class are organized into three teams, carefully graded according to their ability

Digitized by Google
366

in the various phases of the physical education program. The teacher and pupils co-operate m this division of the class. One team captain is then placed in charge of each of these groups, or teams, as they are called.

The class averages from 42 to 46 pupils. Each captain therefore has charge of about 16 children. The 46-minute period allotted to physical education is divided into two periods of approximately 16 nunutes and 30 minutes each. The first period of 16 minutes is devoted to formal gymnastics, marching, and rhythmic exercises, with health instruction and health inspection on alternate days. The second period of 30 minutes is devoted to folk dancing and normal games, such as relay races and other athletic activities, and to more highly organized games such as volley ball, dodgeball, long base, basket ball, baseball, etc. The organization for these games is as follows: Three games are decided upon, the class is divided into six teams, two for each game (the teams play a different game on alternate days of the week.) As far as possible these organized games are played out of doors. In fact, at least one game is always played on the playground unless the weather positively prohibits. In the spring and early fall all the work is earned on out of doom. Each team chooses a name for itself. Each of the three team captains is responsible for one group of two teams.

The rules of the games are also carefully taught to all pupils and any pupil may be called upon to keep score or to referee any game played, at any time.

In the formal work and the dancing each group is led by the team captain or by some pupil appointed by class leader or captain. The three groups may be called together to work as a united whole whenever the teacher desires to introduce a class exercise.

All classes are carefully ranked during the third, sixth, and tenth weeks of each school quarter of 10 weeks. This is done in physical education the same as in arithmetic, reading, history, geography, and other divisions of the school work; ana physical education gets one-seventh of the total credit toward the class standing of each pupil.

The seventh week of the quarter is contest week. For this contest two or three pupils who rank lowest in the first team and two or three who rank highest in the second team are selected for one contesting group. Two or three who rank lowest in the second team and the same number who rank highest in the third team make a second contesting group. On three different days during contest week all contestants are tried out in a variety of athletic skills and games, such as running, jumping, pitching, catching, long throw of light and heavy balls, folk dancing for girls, wrestling for boys, and in as many games as possible. The contestants are judged by the members of their teams and by their teacher. Those ranking the highest in each contesting group are placed in the higher team, those ranking lowest in the Tower team.

In the ranking of pupils, if the teacher and the team do not agree as to the team rank of a certain individual, the class and

367

the individual concerned must prove to the teacher that they are right or submit cheerfully to her judgment.

Those classes which desire to organize class teams for organized games may do so after school hours. Senior and junior championship in the various games are conducted in this manner.

According to Mr. Walters, the principal of the school, this plan of class organization has established "a spirit of co-operation, leadership, responsibility, self-restraint, self-direction, and a socialized democratic atmosphere/’—School Hygiene Review.

ADMINISTERING PHYSICAL EDUCATION.*

By Charles J. Prohaska, M. D. Philadelphia.,

The subject I have selected is by no means one which will give new and startling information, but should recall to the minds of special teachers some of the basic principlas brought out during their preparation, and should make our aims more widely known among school authorities and teachers so that they may look more favorably upon a physical education program.

Dr. Finegan m a report on health instruction said:	“To	give

health instruction we must have the fundamental principle so reduced, and in such simplicity that every teacher knows what he is going to teach every day in the year/’

And so it seems to me that until we have placed physical education on a teachable basis, we cannot look for the best results obtainable. By a teachable basis I mean one of- simplicity and sound principles; one that can be grasped with interest by the school principal and teacher who in turn will interest their classes.

A physical education program of today is a recognized and essential part of every school curriculum, whether that school is in the poorest district of a large city, the wealthiest suburban district, or in the backwoods of a rural community. To be sure, the problems in each case are vastly different, the underlying principles, however, are the same.

With these introductory remarks we may direct our attention to three important topics concerning proper administration:

(1)	The aims of Physical Education.

(2)	The training of a special teacher.

(3)	Administering the program.

If we realize the content of Physical Education the aims may be summed up as hygienic or health producing, educational or habit producing. Dr. Williams, of Columbia University, in his book Physical Education” groups the aims under four headings, viz.: Corrective, Educational, Hygienic, and Recreative. These aims are studied and criticized by Dr. Williams in good fashion and while we may not entirely agree with him, it should stimulate us to look into our program, its aims and results.

368

With the accepted aims as enumerated in the previous statement our attention is next directed to the person who is to carry them out, and we have a right to ask: Who should enter this field?

My answer to this question is, only those who have, or can de* velop a sense of leadership, who are willing to exert both mind and body in preparing, and wno honestly believe in the work that they are preparing to teach.

In Teacher Training Institutions we have a number of students who perhaps have enjoyed some particular phase of Physical Education m their High School work, and for that reason choose physical education as a profession. After becoming acquainted with the actual content of the course, however, this type of student usually lags in those studies which are not entirely interesting to him, but very essential. These students are not sincere. They may graduate ana be placed as teachers, and after teaching for some time their attitude may change so that they realize the importance of a well-balanced course. Unless their attitude changes, however, I can safely say that as teachers they do not entirely believe in their profession and, therefore, should not be teaching it. This type of student should be and is being discouraged at the beginning of their training, and advised against entering the profession.

Then we have a type of grade teachers and college graduates without special preparation, who seek entrance into our ranks largely because of more attractive salaries. These men and women take just enough work in the special subject to enable them to get in, so to speak. There is no serious objection to this type of teacher if they are willing to undergo sufficient training to acquaint them with fundamentals and underlying principles. Unfortunately, however, few of them are willing to spend time and effort in securing this ground work and, therefore, in my estimation, are, as others with a little knowledge, dangerous. I believe I am safe in saying that this is the type who without real good reasons are forever condemning everything in Physical Education with the exception of the few things they are able to put across.

Neither of these types contribute anything to our cause, and as Director of a Teacher Training Course it is my ambition to set standards so high that only those who honestly believe in the work and are willing to work hard to become efficient leaders will enter our ranks.

Since Physical Education is of equal rank with all other phases of Education, and because in addition we are being fitted into health work, I believe that nothing short of a three ana preferably a four year course in preparation should be considered.

You are all more or less familiar with the content of a course in Physical Education, but I sometimes wonder what you consider as major and minor subjects.

If we are to teach Physical Education (which term I mean to include gymnastics, athletics, recreation) then it seems to me the theory and practice of Physical Education should be our major subject, and without being subordinate in any manner; all other subjects should be minors. By this I mean that before any one
369

attempts to teach physical education they themselves should be well trained and properly grounded in the accepted systems and methods of training. After one is personally equipped then and only then should other subjects make their appearance to assure proper guidance, careful and wise selections of materials, and methods of organizing and administering. In this way the major work is Physical Education and must be learned first, and the minors (which in themselves are major subjects) may be thought of as aids in properly administering Physical Education.

Having considered the aims, the type of person and the training necessary to carry out these aims, the final topic remains, administering the program.

The co-operation of the grade teacher is a vital factor in administration. We cannot expect this co-operation, however, until we have placed our materials within her reach. I wonder if you have ever considered what a tremendous influence could be wielded by a teacher who meets the same age group every school day of five hours for forty weeks. Just think of it! Physical training - health instruction in small doses several times a day every school day in the year. If the time ever comes when a grade teacher is obliged to, and makes an earnest effort to do her share of physical training as ■he does mental training, our ideals will appear quite hopeful.

The initial step toward this end must be taken in Normal Schools and other teacher training institutions, and the scope of the work should be somewhat more than merely exercising for personal gains. This is a huge problem and I make no attempts here to help solve it. I mention it as an important phase in proper administration.

The final topic I wish to consider in Administration is, Selection of Material. Unless a special teacher is well grounded in theory and practice it is a difficult matter to select adequate and suitable types of exercise.

A person trained only in athletics knows little of educational and physiological values of free exercise, apparatus work, tactics, dancing, etc. A person fed up only on formal gymnastics appreciates to a small extent the value of recreation and athletics; and a person who believes solely in unorganized and free play has only a very narrow version of physical training, and I sometimes doubt whether the latter could bold the attention of a class long enough to explain anything of educational value.

Physical Education is a broad term and includes all that have mentioned, and to properly administer it one must necessarily have a broad training so that he can apply those phases which meet conditions and solve problems best.

How can one preach the value of postural work with little or no knowledge of Kinesiology - appliea anatomy - or defend the value of athletics and disprove them harmful effects, if any, without a sufficient background in Physiology and Physiology of Exercise.

I dare say a great deal of this type of administration is in vogue, but with what result? Educators and scientists have asked us to

prove the value of Physical Education; and to bring my paper to a close, I ask, are you capable of proving the worth of your profee* sion?

THE PERIODIC EXAMINATION OF WELL CHILDREN.*

By Richard M. Smith, M. D.

The widespread interest in health is one of the most significant developments of the present day. Medical literature contains many discussions of the attitude which the medical profession should take toward this awakening interest. Not a little of the discussion is critical and there is an inclination among certain physicians to feel that groups in the community not trained in medicine are infringing upon the field of medical practice. Hand in hand with this critical attitude there is an insistent plea from other members of the profession that the responsibility for maintaining the health of the well is as great as the responsibility for the care of the sick. It is emphasized that this responsibility is especially urgent in relation to children. It seems to me that there are two

Suite distinct factors involved which are frequently confused in nese discussions. It is essential for us to determine whether or not as a profession we believe that it is important to provide means for keeping children well, in addition to taking care of children when they are rick. If we agree that it is important to keep children well and to protect them from disease, the discussion then centers entirely upon the method by which this promotion of health shall be accomplished. Concerning the first question, e., whether as physicians we should concern ourselves with the health of children, it seems to me that there can be no difference of opinion. It has been shown in the examination of many groups of children that a considerable number from infancy thru adolescence present physical defects and mental handicaps of a nature, which had they been considered earlier, could have been prevented or materially modified. These defects and mental handicaps act as a real and permanent embarrassment to normal living. This was well demonstrated by the large number of refusals in the draft of men at the period of life when th? best health obtains. These men showed defects sufficiently serious to prevent their entering military service. If we study the nature of these defects we shall see that in general they were of the same type as those found among children of preschool age. The latest and most complete statistics bearing out this statement are those found in the report of the Children’s Bureau of the examination of pre-school children in Gary, Indiana. The desirability of promoting the health of children and of preventing the development of physical defects and mental handicaps seems to me so obvious that it is unnecessary to discuss it further. The im-

portant matter for us to consider is by what means we are to accomplish the thing which all of us believe must be done for the health of children.

In the first place, I believe that if we are to establish a method which shall have universal application and which shall have a permanent basis, that method must be related to the other medical work in the community, i. e., it must become a part of the practice of medicine. This means that the medical profession as a whole must assume the responsibility for promoting the health of children. It is true that this will necessitate certain readjustments in medical practice, but these readjustments must take place. In order that physicians may be able to meet this new opportunity for service it will be necessary to modify the courses in the medical schools. Heretofore the instruction has been confined almost exclusively to the diagnosis and treatment of pathological conditions. Very few students upon graduation have adequate knowledge of the normal processes of childhood. This omission must be corrected. For those physicians who have already graduated and whose training was deficient in relation to the care of normal children postgraduate courses must be provided. The need for health supervision of children is so clearly recognized by the public that unless physicians are trained in this particular, other groups in the community will take over the work. A marked disruption of medical practice will result. Physicians must acquire a new point of view toward their patients. The specific information necessary to take care of well children can be easily acquired if we have the right attitude of mind.

The first and most important thing to be done to promote the health of children is to see that they are brought regularly to a

^rian for examination and advice. In my own experience it is very difficult to conduct these periodic examinations as a part of a visit upon a child who is sick. I believe that we should so far as possible encourage the practice among our patients of bringing their children to us for these examinations when the children are well. This should be at a time when we can give quiet, uninterrupted thought to the question of health. The mother has a much freer mind when the child is well to consider and comprehend the advice which we give than when she is anxious because her child is sick. The examinations should be made at least twice a year and a careful record made of all physical findings. It is unnecessary to say that this examination should be complete and that all the clothes should be removed. The measuring of the height and weight should be a part of the examination. It is to be remembered that we are looking not only for evidences of disease, but that we are anxious to discover whether or not there is any departure from normal development. This examination is the basis for our judgment of the child's condition and for whatever advice we may give the mother concerning diet and other matters.

There are certain definite things which we should have in mind at the time of each examination.

Digitized by
372

1.	Is the physical development of the child normal? This includes a consideration of the growth of the body in height and weight, the state of nutrition, the condition of the bones and teeth and posture or bodily mechanics.

The tables used as standards of the height and weight of children are open to many criticisms. They are most of them smoothed curves which eliminate the variations of individual children. They do not take into account the fact that growth does not occur with equal rapidity at all times of the year. The known differences between the various racial and economic groups are not considered. The relation which the individual child bears to other children of the same age and group is of some interest, but of less importance than the record of his own progress. Each child should be measured against his own standard. Porter’s studies of children in the St. Louis schools furnish the most valuable basis for comparative measurements. His conclusion that if we take care of the inches, the pounds will take care themselves is a sound dictum upon which we may proceed.

Quite as important as the question of height and weight are the other evidences of good nutrition. The muscles should be firm, hard and well developed. The color of the mucous membranes should be normal, the skin clear, and subcutaneous tissues of proper texture. The general appearance as shown in eyes and actions should be one of health. If any developmental defect or retardation is present such action should be taken as is indicated by the condition which is found. For instance, in boys it is not at all unusual to discover an undescended testicle sometimes requiring operation for fixation in the scrotum.

Rickets results in various bony deformities, most of which, if not too serious, disappear after a few years. Bow legs and knock knees, however, frequently persist. These may require some treatment—most often accomplished by adjustment of shoes.

Round shoulders, lordosis and a pendulous abdomen are evidences of faulty posture giving rise to bad bodily mechanics. The proper use of the body in sitting and walking can be taught by means of precept—sometimes combined with exercises and rarely with supporting apparatus.

The condition of the teeth is one of the measures of the quality of nutrition during the time of enamel formation. For the first teeth the enamel formation begins in intrauterine life and for the seccnd teeth during the pre-school age period. To prevent caries it is more important to secure good nutrition than to do any other thing. If the diet and hygiene are correct, the teeth will usually erupt in proper position so that approximation of the upper and lower jaw is perfect. When, however, the teeth are irregular or the two jaws are not properly related, attention must be given to corrective measures. If this is undertaken early, it is possible by exercises to accomplish satisfactory results with the use of little or no apparatus. Children should begin early, by the second year,

373

to go regularly to the dentist for cleaning the teeth and for tke detection and treatment of caries, if it exists.

2.	Is there evidence of incipient or early disease or an imperfection in any part of the body? This includes especially eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs and heart.

The examination of the eyes and ears except for gross errors requires special experience, and whenever possible should be done by specialists in these branches of medicine. It is our duty, however, to be sure that these examinations are made. Obstructed nasal breathing is one of the definite deterrents to normal growth and one of the conditions associated most frequently with retarded development. In children this is usually caused by enlarged adenoids. When enlarged adenoids are present they should be removed no matter what the age of the child. If they grow again, they should be removed a second time. Disease of the tonsils is also so closely concerned with nutrition and health that if a child under six years of age has repeated attacks of tonsilitis or if an infection of the tonsils remains m a subacute stage, as it frequently does, the tonsils should be removed. The evidences of subacute infection are irregular surface of the tonsils with deep crypts containing exudate or injected vessels or constant redness of the anterior pillars, or enlarged anterior cervical glands. In children over six years of age the indications for removal of the tonsils need be much less definite than those I have given for the younger children. If these older children have tonsils which on examination give promise of future infections, I believe that as a preventive measure they should be removed.

3.	It is our reponsibility to see that everybody is vaccinated against smallpox. Also we have passed beyond the stage of experimentation in the control of diphtheria. Every child under our care should be immunized against diphtheria by the administration of toxin-antitoxin. The common practice of giving inoculations without the preliminary Schick Test to children under five years of age seems to me right. As further scientific research demonstrates means of producing immunity to other diseases, we should be ready to adopt them. At the present time the two measures mentioned are the only ones which are sufficiently established so that we ought to give them universal application.

4.	We should outline for the child a satisfactory daily routine and give directions for personal hygiene. This involves the prescribing of the right diet, modified according to the age of the child. It is essential in this connection to insist upon proper eating habits— appetite, regularity, eating food as served and many other matters of this nature. Adequate daily bowel movements must b8 secured. The requisite number of hours of sleep at night with a daily midday nap up to the sixth year must be provided. The school curriculum and the outside appointments must be systematized. Fatigue must be eliminated, except a wholesome physical weariness following outdoor exercise. We must see that a reasonable balance is established between work and play and that so far as possible tke causes of nervous excitement are eliminated. All these matters of details in the child’s day are important factors in maintaining
374

his health. The care of the child's body, bathing, fresh air and exercise need to be directed from definite medical knowledge and experience.

5.	We should ask ourselves concerning each one of the children coming to us for examination—is he forming healthy habits of mind or is he developing traits of character which will later become true psychiatric reactions? We know that the first five or six years is the most important period for mental growth and during that time we should endeavor, so far as we are able, to direct the expanding mental life of the child into healthy channels. Many of our efforts will be unsuccessful because of the unfavorable parental environment, but much can be accomplished by careful and painstaking consideration of this aspect of child health.

I have indicated why I believe every well child should receive a periodic examination by a physician, and I have enumerated a few of the most important matters which should be considered at the time of this examination. If the practice thus outlined could be put into universal application, I believe we should do much to promote the health of children and make a real step forward in medical practice. •

CORRELATING HEALTH WORK WITH PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN PLAYGROUNDS.

By Thaddeus Slezynski, Director Holstein Park, Chicago, Illinois.

On returning to recreation work after being engaged for two years in promoting the new national child health program which has developed as a result of the facts disclosed by the draft board reports and by the subsequent investigations of the Federal Children’s Bureau and other nation-wide, state and local organizations, I was struck by the fact that recreation workers had as yet given practically no consideration to the problems involved in these disclosures. Recreation workers and recreation authorities have not asked themselves such questions as— What is the physical stat’is of the children and young people we are serving? What progress, if any, have those who nave been participating in our activities year after year made? Are the children and young people in the neighborhoods around our recreation centers and playgrounds suffering from malnutrition and physical defects to an extent equal to that disclosed in the investigations referred to above? If so, do these conditions preprevent them from profiting from the standardized program that we are offering them? If one out of every three of our children need a supplementary program, what is the responsibility of the playground, especially during the summer, to provide a

program that will appeal to this group and help them raise their physical and health standards?

The measurements of work accomplished in our playgrounds are usually attendance statistics, number of teams entered and winning in tournaments, and the spectacularness of exhibitions and demonstrations (presumably of daily class work). As you know, in the gymnasiums of our centers, children are practically never given even a superficial inspection, and there is usually no method of checking up with the health service in the public schools. Children from homes in which there is contagious disease or children who are themselves convalescing from a contagious disease may attend our classes before the quarantine is lifted.

Tho the school physicians and nurses are attempting to improve the physical condition of many of the children who attend the recreation centers and playgrounds after school hours, the recreation workers take no account of this. An incident which took place in a school in the neighborhood of Holstein Park well illustrates the need for closer co-operation between the two agencies. The principal of the school told a boy suffering from hernia that the doctor had forbidden him to take part in any of the physical training or athletic activities, but met with the reply, "I don’t care, I can go to the Holstein Park and get all the athletics I want.”

A similar lack of co-ordination is evident between the work of the health agencies and the recreation department. A boy who participates in all the activities of our center and who is there most of the time, early and late, appeared to be in poor physical condition. Upo!n questioning, it was found that he had attended the nutrition class at the Municipal Dispensary for more than a year. He had discontinued attendance because he did not want to remain at the summer camp of the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium where he was sent the previous summer. The records at the dispensary show that he had tuberculous glands and that he had not been a co-operative patient. His

Ehysical condition demanded that some adjustment be made in is daily program, but the recreation center had unwittingly been undoing what the dispensary was trying to accomplish. This boy was not only seriously underweight, for height, but he was more than three inches underheight.

In a few communities recreation workers have adopted health activities as a part of the recreation program. In Baltimore, a nurse is employed as supervisor of a health program which includes weighing and measuring, health plays and games, health poster contests and competition among all playgrounds in a Modern Health Crusade Tournament. In Oakland, California an experiment in providing a quiet and airy place for afternoon rest periods has been reported as successful. In Milwaukee, a few school nurses are assigned to playgrounds during the summer months. At the lake Shore Playground in Chicago a director
376

who was a medical student conducted physical examinations for all the young people attending the gymnasium classes. The Playground and Recreation Association reports on a number of smaller cities in the East where definite health activities are a part of the program.

In order to determine the need for a real physical education program as well as for supplementary health activities, in a recreation center and playground an intensive program was initiated at Holstein Park eight months ago. The work is being carried on with the co-operation of the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute, the Elizabeth McCormick Memorial Fund, the Michael Reese Tonsil and Adenoid Clinic, the Children's Memorial Hospital the Municipal Dispensary, Mr. Biggo Bobvjerg, an instructor in physical education, two neighborhood physicians, Dr.

S.	Musial and Dr. M. Uznanski, and our staff of women instruc-ors. A detailed account of the steps in the early development of this program can be found in an article in the October issue (1922) of the Nation’s Health, and in the January, 1923 issue of the Playground.

The work was initiated June 1922 after the regular gymnasium classes had been suspended for the summer. The children were invited to join the Modern Health Crusade—a plan (sponsored by the National Tuberculosis Association) to inculcate health habits thru the appeal to the spirit of competition and play. During the past eight months hundreds of children have enlisted in the Crusade for periods varying from five to thirty weeks. We cannot definitely state what are the permanent results of this mass attempt. However, those children who are found on inspection to be in special need of medical attention are invited to join a special health class limited to twenty children at a time. The Elizabeth McCormick Memorial Fund furnishes the worker for this class, and the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute furnishes the nurse who does the follow-up work. The other organizations and individuals mentioned above are called Upon for service when it is needed.

After obtaining the co-operation of the parents, a medical examination is given to every child applying for admittance to the health class. During the summer months, the average progress of the group was very slow for two reasons. First, ten of the children nad their tonsils removed and did not begin to gain until after they had recovered from the effects of the operation. Second, practically every one of the children attended the playground regularly and found it difficult to refrain from strenuous play and to take the rests as prescribed by the physician. With the opening of school, three of the children were transferred to the fresh air room where rest periods are a part of their regular routine. This group of children were barred from our gymnasium classes and advised to obtain their exercise out in the open air. Two of the girls were so anxious to belong to the gymnasium that after a special effort they qualified for graduation from the health
377

class and were admitted. Recently two others have graduated and four others are expecting to qualify within the next two weeks. Parents are encouraged to attend the weekly meetings of the class, at which both parents and children are questioned to find out to what extent the. children are following out the advice of the physician concerning food and health habits. At each, session the children are weighed and those who repeatedly fail to progress in spite of following out the recommendations are referred back to die physician. The spirit of play and competition are introduced and prizes are given. Each child has a chart on which his gains are recorded, and thus his progress is visualized. We are keeping in touch with the graduates and none of them have become backsliders. Evidently the daily routine during the time the children were in the health class had become a permanent habit.

With the opening of the indoor gymnasium in October all the boys and girls were weighed and measured. Miss Baxter, the instructor in the women’s gymnasium, encourages the girls to accept our offer of a physical examination by giving credit for this, as well as for following out the recommendations of the physician and for coming up to normal weight. Only a small percentage of the.girls have accompanied our nurse to the physician, but many of them have consulted with her regularly and have earned credit for progress made in the improvement of their physical condition.

According to Miss Baxter’s scheme, girls are also given credit for taking shower baths after class, for regular attendance, for taking part in programs, etc. Those attaining the required number of points, at the end of the season will be rewarded with a letter H which they can wear on their sweaters or middies.

In spite of all the attention that has been given to health activities, this has not been at the expense of any part of our other work. The health work has also been co-ordinated with dramatics, with cooking, and with handicraft work, under the supervision of Miss Anne Wayne recreation, instructor. The children assisted in making a little puppet theatre and the dolls that represented characters in several health playlets. A group of 30 Modern Health Crusaders presented a play, “The Seven Keys,” coached by Miss Cook of the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute. The children have also made health posters. The naturally intense interest of parents in the health of their children has brot some of them to the center for the first time. The total attendance in the woman’s gymnasium classes has increased by ova* 1200 for the twelve months ending March 1, 1923. Evidently the health supervision has not driven any of the girls away from attending our gymnasium classes. The classes over which the health supervision has been the greatest are the ones which are too large to handle well. This condition warrants our planning the selection of the girls to be admitted to these classes, turning the remainder into several special classes, the members of which
378

can quailfy for the regular classes after they attain a higher physical and health standard.

The facts gleaned from our brief experience point out that there is a danger of recreation centers and playgrounds running counter to what the schools and health agencies are trying to accomplish by permitting all children to take part in any and all athletic activities without any attempt being made to classify them according to their physical capacity, leaving the choice of activities entirely to the inclination of the individual child. Herein lies an opportunity for greater service which the recreation workers should not be slow to grasp. As the responsibility of the school for the physical welfare of the children has increased, so must the playgrounds aim to do more than keep the children off the street and give them a good time.

This program may sound radical, but after all most of it is included in physical education programs as they are being carried out in institutions where a high standard of work is sought. Physical examinations by instructors trained to perform the simpler tests, referring applicants to a physician if the findings warrant such advice, a record of such examinations with subsequent observations, occasional talks on personal hygiene—all these are considered by most authorities as being essential in any physical education program. So far as the supplementary health activities that are being conducted at Holstein Park, the only innovation is that they are conducted at the Center instead of in a neighboring school building, social settlement or rented store. I believe that the logical headquarters for the district work of our public and private health agencies is in the recreation centers where the opportunity for close contact of health and recreation workers and easy access to each other’s records will bring about understanding and team work otherwise impossible. Some of our recreation centers may not have sufficient space to permit of such a co-ordination of the health work of the community. However, those built in the future should be planned with this use in mind.

The usual excuse of recreation authorities for their failure to raise the standards of physical education in our recreation centers and playground so that it may compare more favorably with that done by the Y. M. C. A. and other organizations, is that it is impossible to secure additional funds to intensify the work. They say that if more funds are secured they have to be used so that greater numbers can be reached. They say it is all very well for private organizations to provide a physical instructor with a number of assistants, require physical examinations, etc. These organizations are supported by voluntary contributors and dues from members who purchase of their own free will the service offered for sale.

As stated in the final volume of the Cleveland Recreation Survey, “Public recreation is limited by the fact that it is paid for out of public money. It has the strengths and the weaknesses
379

of our present municipal governments. It is distinctly political in that it must follow the dictates of popular approval. Consequently, it is apparently kept from attempting any recreation that is anything but wholesale and spectacular. Obscure leadership or scientific experimentation in the field of recreation are apparently not for it at present.”

I could cite many examples of research and experimentation as well as the raising of the standards of welfare work under Federal, State and local governments. I will refer only to two examples with which I am most familiar. When I was a Probation Officer for delinquent boys in the juvenile court of this county, practically every one in our department had between eighty-five and one hundred boys under his supervision. Inquiry a few days ago showed that the average number at present has been reduced to between sixty and seventy boys for one officer. This means that the Judge of the Juvenile Court has been successful in convincing the Board of County Commissioners, a political body, that they should vote the necessary funds so that the probation officers could do more intensive work with the smaller number of cases.

Under the Department of Public Welfare of Illinois there is an Institute of Juvenile Research which, as its name indicates, is a research agency for the study of problem cases of children. To the Chicago office of this Institute there is attached a recreation worker. Miss C. Wanamaker. She handles only cases in which the development of normal recreational interests is apparently the most important part of the problem. Her total assignment of cases per month is somewhere between twelve and fifteen. Well might the tax payer and the legislator protest against the appropriation of public funds for such jobs that apparently give the workers so much time to "loaf.” With private recreational agencies and other public agencies successful in obtaining funds for intensive service, why must the recreation workers and authorities be kept from doing anything but the “wholesale and the spectacular”?

There seems to be a vicious circle which begins with the lack of funds. Then on account of the small salaries paid to the public recreation workers, there is a large turn-over with new untrained people coming into the playgrounds very frequently. Because of this, recreation authorities seem to feel that a simple program is the only kind that can be undertaken. The easiest method of keeping the untrained workers busy is by arranging plenty of tournaments for which teams have to be supplied. This may or may not increase attendance in the gymnasium classes, but it makes news for sporting columns. Since this scheme works so well to the satisfaction of the boards and the public, they naturally see no reason why higher salaries should be paid so. that more intensive work might be undertaken.

The workers themselves are partly to be blamed for the general impression that they can serve even larger numbers than they

Digitized by LjOOQle
380

4o at present, because many of them do not grasp the opportunity to do better work when they have a small number to handle. There are many occasions even during the outdoor season when tiie recreation workers are not so overwhelmed with numbers of children requiring attention. They have many opportunities for more intensive "boys work” and “girl's work,” but many of them do not take advantage of them. During the outdoor season when there happens to be only a few children in the playground instructors can cultivate better acquaintanceship with the children instead of chatting with each other. During the indoor season when on account of bad weather or other causes, the attendance in the gymnasium class is small, too many instructors do not conduct a regular class but give the boys or the girls the ball and remain out of the gymnasium themselves. There are many opportunities for individual consultations with members of classes which would give the instructors not only a knowledge of the physical needs of the children, but would add an educational and ethical value to the work. It is because they find such a content in recreation work that some workers are sticking it out instead of entering the schools where the salaries are much higher, but where the contact with the children is more superficial and the work done more stereotyped. I am fortunate in having such an instructor at Holstein Park who has stuck it out for seven years and who has taken advantage of some of the opportunities referred to.

The organizations that have been assisting in the experiment at Holstein Park, would, I think, be glad to cooperate with the recreation workers in other playgrounds in this city. I know there are similar organizations in other cities. The Municipal Dispensaries of Chicago are anxious to have children taking part in our athletic activities referred to them for examination. Their doctors and nurses are preaching the gospel of a physical examination of every person once a year, and so they would willingly cooperate. The Chicago Tuberculosis Institute would, I am sure, consider assigning a number of muses to the playgrounds, distributing their time among several. These nurses could arrange for the examinations of the children, so that the instructors might not be burdened with this detail. There are other possibilities of cooperation with health agencies that would present themselves as the work developed. Recreation workers who do not make some effort to interest the children under their supervision, in taking advantage of the available health service (when this is functioning and not merely on paper) are negligent of the best interests of the children.

Public recreation authorities are turning their attention to other things besides “the wholesale and the spectacular.” This is not being done without harder work, some criticism and misunderstandings, but if time is taken to record and compare results, our boards and taxpayers will eventually be convinced.
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIEN

D. M. F. KROGH, M. D.

Physiologic Adjustments Attending Muscular Work.—

In order to secure an environment for the bodily tissues as nearly constant as is physiologically possible, profound and rapid adjustments are frequently necessary. Thru changes in activity, new demands are promptly made for energy, on the one hand, and for withdrawal of products of metabolism, on the other. The process of absorption from the alimentary tract pours new material for distribution into the organism. Respiration also is regularly instituting alterations in the gaseous make-up of the circulating mediums. In the midst of this whirl of changes and exchanges, the cellular tissues might easily suffer serious deterioration if some device were not available whereby the internal environment tends to be kept fairly constant for each part of the body.

Every one interested in the human mechanism knows that muscular activity is attended by easily noted reponses in certain of the physiologic functions. The pulse rate is quickened, respiration is augmented in one way or another, and neat tends to accumulate in the organism until it is promptly removed. Vasomotor changes occur so that more blood goes to the active contractile tissues and more to the skin when the temperature rises. In some cases at least, a more rapid beat of the heart appears to be an effort of compensation for fall of blood pressure due to dilatation of the blood vessels in certain parts.

Under conditions of work, the expenditure of energy and corresponding transformation of matter may readily be increased within a few hours of vigorous muscular activity to twice the calory exchange of the resting person. This may mean an additional metabolism involving 2,500 calories or more within the working period; for persons at hard work not infrequently have an energy transformation amounting to 6,000 calories a day. In order that the regulatory devices may be adequate under the great changes thus involved, efficient adjustments are essential. What they may actually mean, so far as the possibilities of aeration of the blood in the lungs are concerned, has been ascertained thru direct measurement on man by Douglas and Haldane* at Oxford. During rest, from 5 to 8 liters (quarts) of blood passed thru the lungs in different men, and during the hardest work the estimated flow was about 24 liters a minute. The blood output per heart beat’in the man of average weight is about 120 c.c. (4 ounces); this frequently remains .unchanged during even severe exertion. The outcome of such unique adjustments is unquestionably most favorable to the individual. The English investigators have further pointed out

that various now available facts are consistent with the view that the rate of blood how thru different tissues is so regulated, as a rule, that the pressure of oxygen and the reaction, that is, the hydrogen ion concentration, remain approximately constant around the tissue elements in each tissue, when the physician prescribes physical exercise to a patient, he is calling the regulatory devices as well as the contractile cells into action, tho he may fail to appreciate this. It is well for him to know the magnitude of the efforts which such exercise sometimes involves.—Editorial ‘.The Journal 0/ the Am. Med. Assoc., May 5,1923.

The Dynamometer in Medicine.—To any one who considers the important part played by muscular efficiency in human welfare, the desirability of having some reliable objective method of evaluating the working power of the contractile tissues must be obvious. Those who recall the introduction of the human ergograph by the Italian physiologist Mosso nearly forty years ago will doubtless confess a disappointment in the outcome of studies with this ingenious device. Aside from a few physiologic investigations indicating the influence of special environmental factors on the power of certain muscles, little has been contributed by its employment to our knowledge of muscular function. The dynamometer also has had a relatively long history of application, primarily by physical trainers who were interested in securing some sort of measure of the success of their efforts. “Strength tests” failed to excite any serious clinical interest, altho they have found a place in the technic of gymnastic training. The need of a reliable criterion of the degree of muscular impairment in surviving sufferers from infantile paralysis led Martin* to devise a dynamometer of a modified type in which the part played bjr the person is to resist a pull rather than to exert his strength in an active effort. The test therefore measures the maximum resistance which the contracted muscles offer against stretching. Furthermore, it is made applicable to numerous muscle groups in various parts of the body. With this device, Lovett and Martin** have been able to ascertain the progress of affected muscles in infantile paralysis, either in the direction of improvement within the limits set by the disease, or as further impairment due to unfavorable conditions. It is not unlikely that dyna-mometry with such improved apparatus will find industrial applications, particularly in the physical classification of employees.* The war has emphasized the importance of considering industrial fatigue; and Martin has suggested that a classification of workers in accordance with their strength may prove to be extremely useful. He has more recently proposed a greater use of the resistance strength test in medicine in connection with the diagnosis and treat-

ment of “effort syndrome,” in the management of which the method has already been applied with apparent advantage; and Smith has pointed out the possible value of well-graded, properly supervised exercise in the later treatment of infectious diseases. If controlled exercise is to play a larger part in therapy, it is increasingly evident that more attention must De paid to the dynamometer or some other instrument for measuring results without mere reliance on the momentary “feelings” or impressions of patients. —Current Comment, The Journal	Am. Med. Assoc., Sept. 23,1922.

Zenos E. Scott, superintendent of schools in Springfield, Mass., addressed more than 300 school superintendents, principals and teachers at the opening of their New England convention November 8th in the State House. Introduced as “one of our newest members whom we have invited to speak in order that we may look him over,” Supt. Scott took for his subject “Leadership in Education”.

One of the greatest problems confronting the teaching profession, he said, is the development of educational leaders in sufficient numbers that each community may have the best possible opportunity for education. Even the teacher in the single room country school is the educational leader of that community, he believed, and as such should realize to the fullest possible extent the responsibility involved. Only by realizing this will the teacher be kept constantly keyed up to the point where the best possible educational service is given, he said.

Mr. Scott made a plea for greater attention to physical education, as being most essential to the upkeep of the teaching profession as well as to the public health. He suggested, as a foundation, the formation of teachers’ golf clubs, if they can be afforded, and, at any rate, the organization of teachers’ walking clubs to develop the physical side of Hie teaching forces.

“It is useless,” he said, “to attempt to impress upon our children the value of physical instruction unless they are able to observe in their own teachers the beneficial effects thereof. We must teach them to play in such a manner as best to develop those qualities of resistence of which they will be in need in later years.

In a recent Sunday issue, The Herald, of Syracuse, N. Y., gave generous attention to the work and record of Paul Krimmel, Super-

visor of Physical Training in the local schools. The chief object was to emphasize and encourage Mr. Krimmel’s agitation for more liberal municipal provisions for this important branch of the Syracuse school service.

In his statement says the Herald, on the subject, Mr. Krimmel lays stress on the lack of proper gymnasium facilities in the High Schools of the city. The truth is that the High Schools are behind the ordinary grade schools in this respect, and it is self-evident that no good reason exists for this discrimination. If properly conducted physical exercise is a desideratum of school training, as we must all admit it to be, the youth of both sexes in the High School should have their full share of its continued benefits.

Mr. Krimmel’s further suggestion of the need of more instructors for the school training on its physical side is one that should not go unheeded. Few people now-a-days will question the merit of a school system which combines study with play and muscular exercise in the right proportions. Playgrounds and gymnasiums are now generally regarded as necessary auxiliaries of classrooms; and all this is but a recognition of the indisputable truth that sound bodies are as essential as sound minds in our budding citizenship. In his survey of the process and development of physical education in Syracuse and in his recommendations for a systematic expansion thereof, Mr. Krimmel’s zeal is surely centered upon a good cause.

A school program m physical education was worked out last summer by the class in "Organization and Administration of School Physical Education" held at Camp Brosius, Elkhart Lake, Wis. This really is a minimum course of study in physical education. The material has been typed and mimeographed covering all phases of work and occupying 25 pages. Each member of the course received and paid for a copy. A few copies are still available. Teachers desiring this course should send $1.25 to W. A. Stecher, 17th and Price Sts., Philadelphia, Pa.

A definite legislative program to push enactment of a national universal physical education law, to provide physical education and instruction for the 30,000,000 school children of America, was decided upon November 10 at a conference of representatives of leading patriotic and educational organizations. The meeting was called by Garland W. Powell, national director of the National Americanism Commission of the American Legmn, who presided.

The purpose of the law is to establish physical education in all schools as a permanent national policy. In order to provide the necessary financial aid and advice to the states, the legislation will require that the administration be placed under the Bureau of Education. The funds will be distributed among the states on a population baas, the states to appropriate at least an equal sum before being entitled to receive Federal aid.

The legislation will not include medical provisions, such as have caused opposition in the past. It is planned to instruct school teachers in physical exercises, who in turn will conduct exercises and games for their pupils, of a character to correct defects is growing children. Mr. Powell said that investigations into the physical condition of the youth of America as disclosed by draft examinations showed that a large proportion would never have existed had the young men received proper training during their school days. John Quinn, national commander of the Legion, has called upon the 12,000 Legion posts to back the legislation.

Casuality lists up to November 10 of the football season contained the names of 11 dead. These figures as usual provoked an outburst from persons not familiar with the game who are ever ready to pronounce it brutal and fit for legal suppression.

An examination of the fatalities shows that most of the victims were young high school boys. To persons familiar with the need of strict physical training, that fact means much. On well regulated college teams, men who "break" training or refuse to abide by strict rules or regime are banished from the squad not only because of discipline but because of the risk such playera run if not in fit condition, says the Monroe, Va., News.

As a consequence of these restrictions it is rare that college men properly trained ever meet death on the gridiron. There are exceptions, of course, but they are unusual. It is quite natural •n the other hand that young boys of high school age, not subject to physical training ana not under the eye of an expert coach, should expose themselves to risks that oft-times result tragically.

Football is a rough game. It calls for physical vigor and intelligence. It has its hazards, but with proper training it is infinitely safer than automobiling, swimming and so many of the ether sports accepted as normal and free from danger.

THE 1923 CONVENTION OF THE NEW JERSEY PHYSICAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION.

The 1923 Convention of the New Jersey Physical Education Association was held December 7th and 8th in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Some three hundred fifty delegates were registered for the convention. Friday morning the delegates visited the schools of Elizabeth. Automobiles were provided by the Elizabeth Chamber of Commerce and the Elizabeth Automobile Association.

The formal program opened with a demonstration of health motion pictures, ana an address given by Mr. Ernest D. Eastern of the New Jersey Anti-Tuberculosis Association.

The Convention Luncheon was held in the new Elks’ Auditorium at its conclusion. The following program was conducted at 2-30 P. M. in the Elks’ Auoitorium.

The aluminum or bronze paint generally applied to radiators itly reduces their effectiveness and makes it necessary to have a rger surface for the same heating effect, according to experiments performed by Dr. W. W. Coblentz of the Bureau of Standards. Dr. Coblentz finds that the heat radiated from an aluminum painted radiator surface is less than a third of that emitted by a radiator of the same size painted with a non-metallic paint, enameled, or simply allowed to rust.

On the other hand he finds that aluminum paint is a very effective means of reducing the amount of heat transmitted thru a thin material. Applied to the under side of a tent or awning it reduces by three-fourths the amount of heat from the sun which gets thru the cloth, while if used on the cover of an automobile or ice wagon it cuts in half the heat let thru and makes the temperature inside the vehicle more nearly that found in natural shade, thereby making it much more comfortable.

This book is by far the best work I have as yet examined for the particular needs of students of physical education, nursing, and kindred studies. Its scope is very extensive and its treatment sufficiently exhaustive. The biologic sequence with the embryologic background should prove extremely valuable to the teaching and learning of the text.

I was particular impressed by the outlines, preceding each chapter, and the clarity of the illustrations. There are very few statements made that are not positive both in description, and what is more important, function. What is not definitely Known to science is not surmised but frankly admitted.

The emphasis is properly placed in regard to pertinent essentials; and the reference to pathologic conditions renders the book extremely interesting.

The terminology employed presupposes some knowledge of the subject on the part of the reader.—Howard L. Conrad.

“Expressive Gymnastics” (Ausdrucks Gymnastik) by Rudolf Bode. 92 pages, 8 1-2 by 11 inches, illustrated. Published by Oscar Beck, Munich, Germany. Second Edition, price $1.50.

Physical education is undergoing the same process of development, of experimentation, in Germany as here in the United States. Anyone who thinks of physical education work in Germany in the terms of free exercise, or calisthenics, or even of apparatus work is woefully far from reality. Practically every recent book on physical education that comes to us from Germany is filled with ideas that show how European teachers are interpreting the present endeavor to get away from formalism.

In the first part of his book Bode presents the psychology of modern physical education; this is followed by methods. The author says that his book shows the results of years of effort in the selection of exercises that have definite “emotional” values. In speaking of the illustrations in his book he calls attention to the fact that it is nearly impossible to explain an exercise by words or by illustrations. Illustrations always show only one part of an exercise; that for printing purposes it is impossible to show the continuous motion involved in an exercise. Further on Bode says that the effect of an exercise always depends upon the personality of the teacher; that pedantic and fossilized teachers should keep their hands from the type of exercises that he presents, as exercises that have any value in expressing emotions must be taught by teachers who can inspire their pupils; by teachers who can feel the value of an exercise. In spite of the forebodings of the author the large halftones representing his exercises are splendid. These pictures
388

alone are worth the price of the book, even to one who can not read a word of the text.

The chapters are arranged as follows: A. Theory I. The psychology of physical education, II. Methods of physical education: a) Science and Life, b) Will and Expression, c) Methods of Expressive Gymnastics, d) Selected movements.

B.	Practise. Description of 150 exercises. I. Introduction, a) relaxing movements, b) heaving movements, c) tension movements, d) rebounding movements. II. Expressive Gymnastics, a) thrusting movements, b) striking and cutting movements, c) pressure movements, d) pulling movements, e) resisting movements.

C.	Illustrations. The exercises spoken of in the practise part are illustrated by 56 splendid pictures. The figures are large and carefully selected. There are 44 representations by single figures (men and women), 4 pictures with two performers, and 4 pictures showing three performers, each engraving being 3 by 4 1-4 inches; while 4 large engravings, 3 1-2 by 5 1-2 inches, show one figure each. The performers are clad either in one piece bathing suits or in a bathing suit with a short flap, thus allowing the full beauty of each pose or motion to be shown.

While the book by no means shows a “system of physical education” it should be of great assistance to teachers who are trying to put more meaning and joy into their physical education work. The book also should be valuable to teachers of dramatics or of dancing.—William A. Stecher.
