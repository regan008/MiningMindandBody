PHENOMENAL GROWTH OF INSTRUCTION IN SWIMMING AND WATERMANSHIP

By Elbridge Colby, Captain of Infantry, United States Army

Undoubtedly one of the most striking adventures in American pedagogy during the first quarter of the twentieth century has been the phenomenal growth of instruction in swimming and watermanship. Whether this has been due to the increasingly artificial modes of our modem urban life, and the consequent necessity of developing means of exercising, or to the phenomenal emulation-producing performances of Charles M. Daniels, Norman Foss, and John Weissmuller, or to the current tendency in academic circles to teach new tricks—it is not possible to say. Let it suffice to remark that swimming has increased to a tremendous degree. Pools are built in high schools. Playgrounds contain swimming facilities. Many colleges include ability at swimming as a prerequisite for a degree. Country clubs are not considered complete without tanks. At

the colleges, aquatic teams take tank with basketball and hockey teams. In military posts, it has become increasingly emphasized that mobility across water is an essential to a moving body of fighting men, a fact ably proven by the experiences of the Fifth and Eighty-ninth Divisions at the Meuse River in 1918. At the summer training camps for civilians instruction in swimming is given as a matter of course. In a single city of average size, a single swimming installation accommodated an average of 2,755 persons a day for the four months of the hot season.

Swimming Now a Nation-Wide Sport

Let the details pass. The days when swimming was used only for heroic exploits, like those of Beowulf, or for amorous adventures, like those of Leander, are gone. Swimming has become a nation-wide sport, and consequently two very important problems have arisen: The problem of developing a suitable technique for teaching swimming and the problem of training leaders and instructors in water safety.

Leading in the campaign for water safety and in the instruction of the general public in this is the American Red Cross that semigovemmental agency which ministers to the dangers and ills of suffering humanity. Scrutinizing the tremendous casualty lists resulting from drowning, the officials of the Red Cross deemed it a proper function of their institution to apply their peace-time energies to this work. So for something more than a decade experts have gone forth who have given instruction and followed by stringent tests. In local Red Cross chapters special agents have been appointed who have promoted community action. A list of qualified life savers was created, and later supplementary examiners were authorized to give instruction ana to give tests in the name of the national organization. By a decentralization of actual organization and a dissemination of correct principles and methods of water rescue, the Red Cross was able to multiply its instruction. With due deference to the signal successes attained by the United States Volunteer Life Saving Coips, notably those units in and about New York City and Providence, R. I., and to the notable work done in the name of the World Life-Saving Alliance, it is still possible to say that the American Red Cross has been the most powerful single force for the promotion of water safety.

Delegation of Authority Responsible for Success

A very large part of the recent success of the Red Cross has been due to its increasing willingness to delegate its instructional and qualifying authority to persons seriously interested in water-sjtfety work and honestly responsible for the progress of instruction in local communities. By such delegation of authority to “.examiners” the few traveling field representatives have been able to devote the major part of their time to general surve* s of the field, the checking up technique and to spreading knowledge of new methods.

A very significant contribution toward the accomplishment of the Red Cross work has been the system of “institutes" held annually in mid-June under the auspices of the life-saving corps. At various boys’ or girls’ summer camps, the Red Cross has held preseason camps of its own, devoted to intensive 7 or 10 day instruction in water safety. To these camps come, as volunteer members of the “faculty,” certain specially invited experts who give freely of their time; and young men and young women also come who are destined to become water-front directors at boys’ camps, or counsellors at girls' camps, or instructors in physical training, or volunteer swimming teachers or life guards at scout camps. The type of students is of high grade; the majority of them are college people. In late June they put in seven strenuous days, jumping from one bathing suit to another, it seems, to fit themselves for aquatic responsibilities in the July and August camps of the regular recreational type. So favorably is this work of the Red Cross looked upon by the associated summer camps that the officials are able to secure camp sites for their pre-season courses by voluntary, gratuitous donations. So popular is this work that the “institute” camps are increasing in number from year to year. And as they increase, knowledge of watermanship and the habits of water safety are disseminated more and more widely.

Red Cross Camps Numerously Attended

To these camps, under a special invitation, and in view of the very special relationship existing between the Red Cross and the Army, come officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army; to learn the approved technique and insure proper precautions at the swimming pools and places maintained by the Army at its posts, camps, and stations. To these camps come also young and old, the spry and the sedate, the active instructors and the advisory executives—all ready to be indoctrinated and to secure the best advice on their work.

Other institutions which have taken up the work of making water sports safer are the Tumvereins of the larger cities of the United States. Many of them havef installedjswimming pools for the use of their own members and their turning school instructors are required to give instruction in swimming to the hundreds of pupils who make use of the gymnasium facilities. The Normal College of the Turner organization maintains a summer camp school at Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, where prospective gymnasium teachers are taught the various methods of swimming in order that they may be fitted to train the pupils they will instruct in the Tumvereins.

It is not just to say that no systematic instruction in swimming is given in this country. In Chicago, New York, Boston, and Springfield are institutions of pedagogical learning that produce swimming instructors. Yet it is perfectly just to say that instruction in swimming is more heterogeneous and less uniformly organized than any other kind of instruction. Indeed, the varieties of method in teaching people to swim

Google

are multitudinous. “Use no artificial aids” demands one authority. “Use this or	that	one” answers	a rival. “Teach	the

breast stroke first”	says	Mr. Sullivan of Princeton. "Do	not

teach the breast stroke at all” says the famous Mr. Lou Hand-ley, of New York. “Teach the dog-paddle first” announces another authority. “Learning swimming is individualistic” declares Mr. Barnes from the west. And so—on—and on. All are agreed that the old system—hurl him overboard and let him sink or swim—is now improper; but that is the only agreement; and it may be pointed out that if that method were adopted there would be no need of swimming instructors, so the instructors naturally look upon it with disfavor.

It is proper to	say,	therefore, that	swimming instruction is

as yet in a heterogenous	state; and the	reasons for it are	sev-

eral. In the first place, we have been experimenting with this type of pedagogy only 25 years or so. Then we are teaching one of the most difficult things in the world, teaching what Thorndike would call “form” and “execution” in a process that can never become secondary; it must always be the result of conscious effort, and can never slip into the remoteness of automatic responses like typing by “touch system" on a standard keyboard. In teaching swimming the instructor is confronted more vitally with the problem of teaching confidence and with elemental instincts attempting to vitiate his work.

Must Overcome Natural Reactions

Man is not naturally amphibian. If forced into the water against h.is will, be revolts by nature. The problem is a problem in vitiating basic reactions—how to avoid the rigidity of fear and acquire the relaxation of easy grace. Many a man has produced hi? own pet scheme and the texts on swimming will show many pets. For the various uses of swimming there are many strokes. But for the beginner there is but one prob-blem, the problem of counteracting an automatic almost reflex action of the muscles and of slowing the action to a cadence of rhythm and grace. In the Army the breast stroke is preferred because it is the stroke most easily swum with full field equipment, and in competitive circles the “crawl” is the one most generally swum, because it is the most efficient for a man with a silk racing suit. In the Red Cross, they emphasize the side stroke and the “reverse scissor” kick. There you have it.

I feel that swimming instruction has progressed and that American waterfront recreation is becoming increasingly popular and increasingly safe. But I can not feel the systematic study has yet produced any conclusive body of doctrine on the topic, soundly based on psychological laws and proved by widely gathered experimentations. The professional schools of pedagogy have experts working on the topics—or if they have not they ought to have. A scrutiny of the psychology of teaching swimming would not be nearly so academic as a scrutiny of teaching spelling pr arithmetic, nor probably so universally

used. Yet I somehow feel that such a scrutiny would be eminently more interesting because more concerned with innate prejudices, mental aversions, and general human traits, rather than with mere brain manipulation. I feel that the study has but just begun.	School	Life.

THE CHALLENGE OF LEISURE TO INTELLIGENCE

By Willis Allen Parker, Ph. D.

Suppose, as Bacon did, that a new continent, as large as Australia or America, should anse suddenly out of the sea. Suppose it possessed mountain ranges, rivers, plains, fertile soil, mineral wealth, and all the opportunities of a new frontier to adventure, discovery, settlement, invention, and human culture. What other country could equal it in interest, in power to attract, and in possibility to develop a finer civilization? Who would not be tempted to forsake his native land to hurry thither, and experience the joy which men find always, in laying foundations and shaping the future of such a plastic society? What hopes we would have that the wrongs and abuses that afflict us here, m this best pf countries, might be prevented in the new democracy we would strive to build.

Such a supposition is fanciful, of course,—this dream of a New Atlantis. But a reality, no less revolutionary, a continent no less rich, has actually arisen in our time, and in our very midst. It is the new leisure that machinery, swift travel, fixed hours of labor, long evenings, lack of chores, and specialized work have suddenly provided. Spare time has come to be the privilege of all,—the common people,—to an extent heretofore enjoyed by none but the privileged few.

Add to this leisure the fact of larger luxury; consider that amusements, travel, and a hundred enjoyments have come to be shared by all, with equal suddenness. Then conceive of the larger liberty which our sudden wealth of time has bestowed, and we have the explanation of that which makes us most concerned about our times. It is the problem of controlling and shaping this new and precious possession into a thing of beauty and of joy. For manifestly, it is a treasure. Leisure, as nearly as anything that can be conceived, represents the goal of human struggle, the aim of endeavor. Long life, wealth, learning, are all desired as means to its enjoyment.

But these new possessions, leisure, luxury, and liberty, are perilous. They make us anxious. They threaten to set aside finer things. Especially do they beguile our youth into adventures, excesses, and hazards that life can ill afford. Shall we condemn our young people for the zest with which they take up new pleasures? Shall we wonder that they are bewildered and often led astray? Does any one fancy he could have withstood better, such a sweeping flood of tendency, in his own adolescence? Our youth are probably not worse and not better than their elders would have been under the same conditions. The way of intel-

ligence is not to condemn, but to control these tendencies, and make possible and attractive a finer order of things.

Consider the problem of public health. What opportunities exist in leisure for its promotion, preservation, and insurance for the future! Time can be taken by intelligent people to confer, and leadership is available to guide them in building up standards to lift life up toward its fullest possible content and enjoyment. Why should not every community have a consecrated group, determined to increase the weight, strength, and performing and enjoying power of every individual in the community?

Consider welfare. Every countryside, village, and larger community has its unfortunate, its depraved, its misfits and its problematical individuals, liabilities rather than assets. Here is another field for another group, who prefer prevention to cure. Why wait for the jails, the hospitals, and the poor houses to shelter these, when leisure and luxury exist in measure sufficient for their proper care and guidance by the more fortunate? Such activity is adventure, education, and reward all in one.

Consider recreation. Americans especially have gone daft over amusement. Amusement is not recreation; often the opposite. Amusement is passive; recreation is active. Amusement is depriving; recreation is rewarding. Amusement is what another does for you; recreation is what you do for yourself. We waste billions annually upon second rate and third rate heroes and heroines, making them the headliners in our amusement places, when intelligent planning would enable us better to recreate ourselves. Every community should have a hundred or more people, devoting their leisure to planning spare time activities for all. Playground and leadership to insure to every child the right to play; swimming and wading places; tennis, handball, marbles, tops, kites, roller skating; twilight or night leagues for outdoor games, for juniors and adults; a free golf course for every community of ten thousand, even if the four hundred must share it, or play away from home; and self-expression, by the drama, by the pageant, by music, with brass bands for boys, orchestra, carols, and choral societies, even bands of serenaders with guitar, ukulele, or the jew’s-harp. One North Carolina city has 80 boys who play the harmonica, or mouth organ, together. Why not 800?

Use the facilities. Every modem community has space for play, or can obtain it. Every city has buildings, such as halls, schools, churches, used but a fraction of the time, that can be obtained for leisure time activities. Some in every city are anxious to have the place grow larger; why not all be concerned to have the city finer? The largest cities are mostly squalid, commonplace, and unattractive. But every community can be fine. What Dresden is to opera and Paris is to painting and plastic art, and Milan is to architecture, and Oberammergau is to sacred drama, every community that cares can become to be something beautiful and fine. The opportunity is here. Leisure is its field. Its challenge is to our intelligence.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION

M. L. Townsend, M. D. Raleigh, N. C.

Physical Education is a phase of school activity which has been wofully ignored in the recent past, but thanks to the present trend of thought, it is now being given more attention and a recognized place in the proper evolution of child life. Physical Education is not a new idea—it is as old as the history of education—it antedates by milleniums purposeful mental education.

There is today a very hazy conception in the minds of most of us of just what physical education is. We have very vague ideas of any differentiation between physical and mental education. Many of us indeed just let the one word education cover the whole field without troubling ourselves to think whether we refer to developing the mind or the body. If by chance we consciously intend the term to mean the composite development of the individual in his every phase, which of course is what we all think we mean, then we fail to analyze and recognize the various phases leading up to this objective—we fail to classify what we are already doing as to physical education or mental education.

There is a legend, or if there is not, we will now fabricate such a legend, which describes a savage Indian in Peru back in the morning of time who, stricken with violent malaria, crawled to a little basin in a rock to quench his burning thirst, with the rain water caught and held in this little basin. He found the basin filled with fallen twigs which he scratched out, and which left the water very bitter. Nevertheless, he was unable to move farther, and burning with thirst and in dying, semi-consciousness, he drank the bitter brew. He got well and told the story of his harrowing experience, including the bitter potion which he drank. Then others also learned that they would be cured of violent chills and fever by drinking water in which had been soaked this special kind of twigs. These twigs were fallen from cinchona trees. Cinchona extract and its alkaloid quinine have been known to cure malaria almost from time immemorial, although no one had the slightest idea what malaria was nor why quinine cured it. The whole process was empirical. We do a very great many things in life without the least idea why we do them. When science told us what malaria is and what quinine is, then the empirical use of quinine for the treatment of malaria ceased to be empirical and became scientific. From the hour when such treatment became understood—became scientific—then progress really began in the eradication of malaria. When we . get a clear conception of why we do certain things to our children in school which we have always done empirically, we can then do those things in our teaching work with a definite goal in view. We can then work scientifically.

Much of our physical eduction has been done and is being done purely empirically. In doing it we have had not the slightest idea why we did it, nor even that much of what we were doing was educational in any sense.

When I studied Latin I had no real idea why I studied Latin other than that I was told to do so. Many who teach Latin have but faint idea why they teach Latin other than that they are told to teach it. The results of such study and such empirical teaching are very poor. After years of Caesar and Virgil, I find myself right now greatly embarrassed because I want to quote in Latin the text of what I wish to say. Many years ago a great Roman philosopher and teacher said that the greatest goal for human endeavor was mens sana in corpore sano. That may not be what he said in Latin but I do know that the translation into English is “a sound mind in a sound body.” And this today is the ultimate goal of every phase of school life. A sound mind in a sound body, in the fullest and broadest meaning of that phrase expresses the ultimate aim of life.

The great teacher Himself recognized the importance of both physical and spiritual health. He spent His life healing the body as well as the mind and gave His life to expand the horizon of the soul.

In theory, educators believe that health is more important than a wealth of knowledge; in actual practice however, they rarely follow this belief. The problem in physical education is to conserve and promote health through systematic motor activity. When the baby reaches out his hand for the moon he is getting education, both mental and physical. He is learning the distance of the moon and the limits of his own arm. When the child is playing his games at school he is getting education both physical and mental. Recreational activities offered at school tend to affect the entire life of the individual. Habits of outdoor recreation and wholesome leisure time activities are fostered and promoted.

Recreation and moral conduct are closely related. More and more the individual will behave aright, not so much because there is some one watching and checking up his behavior, as because right ideals and interests have been built into his life.

We shall encourage and promote every means that may help to make our boys and girls physically, mentally and morally fit now that they may be the better physically, mentally and morally fit for their future duties as citizens.

The goal of all education is a sound mind in a sound body. The goal of physical education is the promotion of health, strength and efficiency by the establishment of a satisfying and intelligent interest in active exercise.

It is not enough that physical education carry only the thought of body development.

Properly directed physical education perhaps more than any other factor counts for the development of such virtues as a social sense, including qualities such as subordination, self sacrifice, co-

operation, loyalty, initiative, leadership, sportsmanship and respect for the rights of others. Such basal virtues in the child and adolescent are taught through the inspiring personalities of teachers during their direction of activities more often than they are taught through definite moral instruction in the class room. If I could not have my choice of instructors for my child in both the class room and on the play ground, I would be less careful of the instructors in the class room. If the “win at any cost” idea dominates the coach, he may be the most potent factor in the community in destroying the moral ideals and the ethical standards of future leaders. If he does not, by precept and example, teach his children to play the game square in school he is teaching them not to play the game of life square. If he does not teach them in school to play the game aggressively, he is teaching them not to be aggressive in later life.

Boys and girls in school and high school are great hero worshipers hence the greatest possible obligation which every teacher must carry is the responsibility of being the hero of his pupils. In the matter of athletes the individual in charge should be a comrade as well as captain, not merely a leader or boss.

Time and thought should be given to the preparation of the daily physical education activities.

Leadership among pupils themselves should be encouraged. Games and athletics should be provided for all in order that all may receive <;he benefit. The purpose is to develop athletics and not athletes. The purpose of athletics is not to develop winning teams but to develop a sound mind in a sound body.

One thing we must always keep in mind is that play is not of itself physical education. Play may be exercise but undirected play may be not only not beneficial but actually harmful. A child stooped over a bench in a mill may be making physical exertion far beyond her strength and still grow up a physical dwarf. It may sound foolish to say that a farmer boy or girl who walks to school and does all sorts of work and chores at home needs physical education.

This leads us to the very heart of the whole matter. The physical director must take into consideration the peculiar and individual needs of each child. These needs must be determined by a careful survey of the child’s environment together with a careful physical examination. What one child may need more, another may not need at all. Only after this careful survey may a plan be made that can be scientifically justified. And while empirical physical education may do some good it cannot be depended on. A child that is already doing a special kind of work is perhaps using all its strength in that one direction and neglecting many other muscles or sets of muscles. Such a child needs to be directed in the way of developing the entire body. Then physical education must also be curative. Many children have

Ehysical deformities and physical deficiencies which can so easily e overcome by intelligent physical education. Hunch back, round shoulder, twisted spines, droop shoulder, flat foot, broken

arches and a host of things are traceable directly to faulty physical direction and can very largely be overcome by intelligent scientific physical education.

First we must learn what each child needs and then set about in an intelligent way to supply that need. Empirical physical training no longer can be permitted.

Children in school in classes will eagerly do things they could scarcely be induced to do alone at home. This is because we all want to do things that are popular. When it has been made popular to chop wood or hoe in the garden or chase a golf ball all over a field people do those things as eagerly as they play ball. This illustrates the absolute need of popularizing the thing and securing interest. By the way, this psychological fact holds just as true of all forms of school work. There are millions who curse mathematics or Latin or what not simply because some teacher did not have the ability to make the subject interesting and popular. When a child says “I just hate math,” it’s pretty sure the teacher is at fault. The first consideration in physical education is to find out just what the child needs and then study to determine just what exercises will supply that need. The next consideration, but one which should hardly be given second place, is to study and make sure, that whatever procedure is needed be made interesting. Compulsory physical education can scarcely accomplish better results than the compulsory study of Latin.

Then finally the one thing more than all else wnich I wish to emphasize is that girls need this phyiscal education, generally speaking, much more than boys. During the earlier school years the girls and boys can well have the same forms of exercise but in later school years after the .age of puberty, there comes to be a difference in skeleton and muscles which makes it better to give the sexes their own classes. No class of girls should have a man physical director, and neither should any class of boys have a woman physical director. The reason for this is not necessarily in any sense a matter of propriety any more than that all women should have a woman doctor but the reason is because the physical director cannot secure best results unless he can be a comrade in the work and men and women do not think alike nor act alike, nor are their needs always the same. However hard he tries, a man cannot be a woman nor a can a woman be a man. If you will stop to think over the playmates of your childhood you will be impressed with the fact that the girls who grew up active outdoor sports, the so-called “tom-boy” seldom grew up to be the chronic, neurotic invalids. This class of women, of whom there are so many, are almost invariably the ones who were the “little old women” children. If you cannot have physical education for both boys and girls, put your emphasis on the girls and make active outdoor athletes of them all.

Now once more for a parting word. Your only purpose in life should be to develop athletics and not athletes. The success of the work will be measured by the general average. Attention must be directed to those who need it most. School athletics

might lose much of its thrill if it were not for the winning teams, and winning teams are an inspiration to the others. But also winning teams may be a great discouragement to the individual who cannot make these teams. If winning teams is the only thought, then the one who needs physical education most is very sure to say, “I can never make the team so what is the use of my trying.” Most “coaches” defeat their own purpose in life by giving all attention to a very small group and that group composed of the very ones who need his help least.

ATHLETICS FOR WOMEN: GENERAL TRAINING

Miss F. Birchenough, M. B. A. P. T.

With athletics, as with most other branches of sport, it is the general training that counts for more than anything else when the actual day of competition arrives. No matter how fit or energetic the competitor feels at the time of the event, she cannot be at the top of her form without previous training. What is more, to enter an event having had no due preparation for it, will do infinitely more harm than good, and is just a way of asking for trouble.

There are several things to be considered when commencing serious training for athletics. First comes the all important question of how much to do. This varies a little according to the strength of the individual, but it is wiser to err on the side of too little than to overdo it. A half-hour spent on the track twice a week—or even three times, providing there is no competition entered for in addition—is of much more benefit than an hour on one or more evenings; the latter method merely exhausting the muscles instead of toning them up. Training for any event should always be preceded by a gentle run, during which all the parts of the body are brought into play, to loosen all the muscles, and so minimise the danger of strain or accident while practising. All that is done should be on the gentle side, and style aimed at rather than excessive speed or distance, the “all out” stage being reserved for competitions or occasional practises.

Secondly, the question of events suitable to herself should receive careful thought on the part of the would-be aspirant to athletic honors, and is, of course, largely a matter of build and physical strength. For instance, a girl who found that “putting the shot” or “throwing the javelin” kept her back and shoulder muscles in a state of continual stiffness, or that a “distance run” of 440 to 880 yds. resulted in intense physical discomfort, both immediately and for a day or two afterwards, would be wise to leave them alone, and take up jumping or sprint running. In clubs where the members are lucky enough to have a trainer, such matters as these are looked into, and advice given as to suitability

of events, amount of practice advisable for each athlete, etc.; but in cases where such expert advice is unobtainable each one must be guided by her own experiences, and by Nature’s reminders as to when the body's resources have been overtaxed.

The correct kind of diet is a matter that is often raised, and the usual recommendation is to eat as one does normally, but with special avoidance of the richer and more indigestible foods. Drink sparingly, especially before vigorous exercise, and on no account do anything strenuous for quite two hours after eating.

A little attention is also needed in the matter of personal hygiene. Exercise always necessitates extra cleansing of the skin, and warm baths and cold or tepid "sponge-downs” are extremely beneficial. A hot bath should never be taken just after profuse perspiration has taken place, this having a very weakening effect, in addition to making a further call on the already taxed organs and muscles. Light massage before and after training (especially the latter) is an excellent thing if procurable. Two minutes of breathing exercises per day will repay tenfold the time spent in doing them, and special developing movements can be learned and used to help in particular events.

If training has been careful and of sufficient duration, the strain of actual competition will be practically nil, the nervous system being the one chiefly affected. This effect, of course, should be good for one, as control and great concentration are essential on such an occasion. If, however, it is found that exhaustion and general irritability during the next few days are the result, competitions should be left alone for a while, or considerably lessened inn umber.

The summer months are primarily the time for athletics, although something can be done during the winter. Cross-country Running, Hockey, Netball, etc., help towards keeping fit generally; while High-Jumping, Shot-Putting, Hurdles, and Running Starts cap well be practised in a gymnasium. When the warmer days arrive, however, the track claims its own, and on fine summer evenings you may see on the sports fields and training grounds in and around London, dozens of neatly clad “Atalantas” taking full advantage of the hours of daylight left to them after business hours.

Athletic exercise should never be undertaken while feeling unfit or very tired, for then the gain is nil, and the loss possibly great. Above all, let it be remembered that athletics are a means to an end,- that of a healthy body and mind—and not an end in themselves.

STUDENT HELPERS

Henry S. Curtis, Jefferson City, Mo.

There is a feeling on the part of some, that schools are doing too much for children and expecting of them too little in return. The easiest way to develop loyalty to any organization or institution is to work for it

For more than a century in Europe each country has required certain years of army service of all of its young men. This has been one of the chief ways of developing loyalty. There has also been discussion for many years of requiring a similar service of all women to be rendered in hospitals, kindergartens, day nurseries and similar institutions.

The high school is the great school for the training of loyalty and also for the training of leaders. The great mass of the workers stop their education with the elementary school but most leaders have something approaching a high school education. They should have some civic or public work.

The Russian system calls for all the janitor work to be done by the children and for them to make any improvements about the schools that are possible. Under the system in Gary, the boys make the school desks and tables, and the teachers’ desks, paint and make repairs about the building, manufacture the playground equipment, and do many other things of this sort. At Lebanon, under Superintendent Cramer the boys have made the jumping pits, running track, and volley ball and basketball courts. In many places manual training classes have made the dumb bells, Indian clubs and wands.

The boys in the junior and senior years of high school are practically adult in strength and physical development. If any school might hire 100 men to spend a day in putting in improvements on their school grounds they would expect to see wonderful results, but there are 100 young men in many of the high schools who ought to be glad to put at least one day a year, if needed, into improvements of this sort.

In schools having manual training equipment it should be quite possible fot them to make the dumb bells, Indian clubs, wands, jumping standards, frame work for horizontal bars, etc. If they have also structural iron woik they may make a good share of the playground equipment also.

On every school ground the students should make the jumping pits, running tracks, volley ball and basketball courts. They can do this work quite as well as any workers that could be hired and they will feel very differently toward it if they have done the work. This will make it possible also for every school that has the ground to have these facilities.

In rural high schools country boys accustomed to using plows, scrapers and drags should be able also to grade and level the ground.

The school athletic program which reaches only ten or fifteen percent of the student body is usually financed from the gate receipts. In places where the money for physical education is inadequate, something may be done in this way; an entertainment given by the school, which will include folk dancing, a cal-isthenic drill and perhaps a match game in basketball will draw the parents and will often yield a considerable financial return. An outdoor field day will often be attended by thousands. The parents will come to almost any entertainment given by their children, however insignificant the exhibition may be.

One of the new extra curricular activities in the high school is dramatics. The plays given are usually more wholesome and entertaining than the ones given in town. Two or three plays will yield a considerable financial return.

High school pupils are learning to be effective citizens. We hope they are going to work for a greater country and a better civilization. One feature, in which they are vitally interested is the improvement of the facilities for athletics and physical education. Most bond issues for larger grounds and better schools have been carried by the children through making posters, organizing parades, and similar activities. It is a legitimate part of their civic education to further movements of this sort.

High school education should include some education in leadership. Every girl in view of the requirements of later life and motherhood should have some training in organizing the games of little children. Teacher-training students should all have a considerable experience in organizing playground activities. All high school pupils who are capable should have an opportunity to be squad leaders and at times serve in the organizations of the activities of the junior high schools. In Detroit and in Gary students, serving in this way get high school credit which enables them to finish a technical course in physical education in less time.

The activities that have been outlined are in the main excellent physical exercise. As good as anything that can be prescribed they help to develop loyalty and school spirit and they give the districts without money an opportunity to get practically as good facilities as the rich districts. There could be no better demonstration of the power of leadership in the superintendent and of the right spirit in the student body then the ability to get this work done in this way. It is not expected that it can be done at every school or that it can all be done in one year, but something can be done nearly everywhere. Wherever it is possible it will be worth while. It should be talked over with the student body, improvements that might be made outlined, and volunteers called for. School might be dismissed at noon on Friday provided the boys will agree to work for the afternoon.

MASSACHUSETTS HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION*

All-Student Meet, 1924.

Report prepared by John M. Gallagher, Boston High School of Commerce.

Part I. The third annual triathlon of the Massachusetts High Schools was completed in the month of May, 1924. The physical education department of each high school had been notified by the State Department of Education to prepare the pupils of the two upper classes for these tests and were

requested to carry out the plan on their own grounds in their own manner following the prescribed conditions. Sixteen high schools reported that they were able to accomplish the task with the boys and eighteen schools reported the successful accomplishment in the girls' department. A total of 1347 boys and 1420 girl participated in the contest.

The following tables show the averages, the schools being arranged in the order of excellence with respect to the “Adjusted School Average” for each per cent of enrollment over 80 that participated.

The Prize Cup in the Boys’ contest for scoring the best average is therefore awarded to the Williams High School of Stockbridge. The individuals averaged 21.67 points and to this was added 5 points for 100 per cent participation. The Cup in the Girls’ contest also was won by the Williams High School. The individuals made an average of 21.58, which was increased 5 points because of 100 per cent participation.

A State certificate of proficiency will be issued to all the schools recorded in the table. Plaques will be awarded to the Williams High School and to Westford Academy, these being the “two per cent of the competing schools” making the highest averages in the contest for Boys. The Williams High School and the Fairhaven High School will receive plaques for doing the best in the Girls’ contest.

Certificates of Merit will be issued by the Sate to the twenty-five individuals who made the highest scores, namely:

Boys

30 points: Hughes of Watertown, Ladd of Stockbridge, Brinn of Waltham, Madison and Livermore of Drury, Anderson and Bergeron of Brockton, Leary of Holyoke.

29	points: Day of Watertown, Malumphy of Stockbridge, Richardson of Natick, Holbrook of Waltham, Harvey of Townsend, G. Smith of Brockton; Carroll, Williamson, Herk and Majeau of Holyoke.

28	points: Harris, Paolera, and Sabin of Watertown; Lolas of Chicopee; Ritschie, Petrie, and Bringan of Drury; Charles of Hitchcock; Morrill, Willis, Rosen, Jackson, and Sundstrom of Brockton; Stott, Holland, and Smith of Holyoke.

Girls

30	points: R. Robbins of Leominster; M. Menaguale and G. Warner of Williams; M. Matfield and D. Ryan of Natick; E. Jason of Fairhaven; M. Andrews and C. Bigham of Waltham; E. Clare, E. Heggie, and A. Maher of Drury; M. Jones, S. Pari-seau, M. Picard, D. Utley and D. Sullivan of Holyoke; E. Nelson of Townsend; M. Gove of Brockton.

29	points: J. Meekham of Leominster, M. Moschard of Waltham; E. Lorimer of Chicopee; M. Hyde, D. Nixon, D. Thompson, and C. Wilcox of Drury; D. Shea of Holyoke.

The reports and comments received all indicate enthusiasm on the part of the schools that managed to complete the task.

It is of course admitted that the large high school is contracting for the expenditure of a tremendous amount of time and labor in attempting these tests. Brockton High School is especially commended for accomplishing these tests with 693 pupils, 100 per cent of the enrollment. The Holyoke High School was the second largest school in the contest, testing 448 pupils. In Leominster these tests were undertaken successfully with the pupils of the 10th, 9th, 8th, and 7th school-year.

Recommendations The Scale of Measurements. The purpose of the All-Student Meet is of course Physical Culture, and not athletic competition. Therefore the scale of measurement should be arranged so that a grade of excellence in a certain event might be attained by at least 15 per cent of the enrollment. Those individuals who score 20 points out of a possible 30 might be given a diploma by the State certifying a fair degree of physical agility and muscular activity. Those who score 25 points should be declared “excellent,” and those who score 30 points should be declared "supremely developed.”

Comparison of School Averages. To make the All-Student Meet a contest among schools, all pupils should take part. Only those pupils should be excused from these events that are regularly excused from attending physical-education classes. Eligible pupils who do not compete should be recorded as scoring zero in each event.

Judging and Timing Events. Comparative school results would naturally be of little value if the judging and timing of events were poorly or carelessly done. All athletic coaches are aware that professional timers announce much slower time in dash events than the less-experienced timers do. Since we desire to compare general results, it is necessary to forbid the use of spiked shoes in running and jumping. It is quite probable that a ten-second sprinter would be slowed up ten yards or one second if deprived of the use of spiked shoes. While the loss might be proportionally less among school-boys, it is safe to assume that our' highest grade for the 100 yard-dash, 11 2-5 seconds, would be at least 3-5 of a second better with spikes.

Part II Supplementary report by John M.- Gallagher.

The general tabulated results of the third annual All-Student contest are published in the preceding part. These results show progression in individual accomplishment and in numbers over the preceding year. The contest consisted in testing all the pupils of the two upper classes in three athletic events: the boys trying the 100-yard dash, the running high jump, and the running broad jump; the girls doing the 50-yard dash, the running high jump, and the basket-ball throw. The scoring table, or scale of measurement, was as follows:-

Prize Cups were awarded in both the Boys’ Contest and the Girls’ Contest to the schools that made the best average score per pupil. Eighty per cent of the eligible enrollment had to compete, and in order to induce 100-per cent participation among the pupils an increment of one-fourth of a point was added to the accomplished pupil-average for each per cent over 80 that participated. Plaques were issued by the State Department of Education to the “two per cent of the competing schools” making the highest averages. The State Department of Education also issued Certificates of Merit to the 25 boys and the 25 girls making the best individual totals.

The summarizing of the individual scoring by events is an interesting study, and may give a little enlightenment on the subject of “mass athletics.” Certainly there are many surprises coming to those who may believe that every able-bodied boy or girl has sufficient natural physical agility, or has a sufficient degree of muscular control. For example, it is surprising to discover that there are so many able-bodied girls who cannot throw a basket ball the length of a schoolroom; and who would believe there are so many that cannot jump pver a bar two feet high?

For purposes of study and for generalizing results, I have converted the actual results to a scale of 1000 pupils; that is, each table shows the number of pupils in a thousand that accomplished a particular record. For example, in the Boys 100-yard dash in the Brockton High School 24-1000 of those contesting scored 10 points (or a record of 11 2-5 seconds); 131-1000 of the pupils scored 9 points, and so on.

The tables might be studied to determine just what the present status of the “pupil-mass” is, with respect to athletic development; what weaknesses there are in all youths; what standard of accomplishment should be set to call a pupil “passable” in a certain event; whether those schools that have been able to give considerable gymnastic class-instruction in a particular event (say high jump) show the expected superior accomplishment in that event.

The tables should be studied also to determine whether the scale of measurement might be altered to advantage. Scales of measurement in other states are based on world-record accomplishments; that is, the maximum number of points is given for equaling the world’s record, and the points scaled down accordingly. I question the advisability of that plan. For our prime purpose is to develop those who are undeveloped, and not to train the excellent to be super-excellent. Therefore the grade of excellence in a certain athletic event should be as easy of attainment as it is in English or in Mathematics. Similarly the inferior limit should be so low that almost no one should fai) to accomplish it, while one point should be given to those who do fail, and zero should be given only to those who do not try.

The tables might be studied to investigate whether the average pupils in one city be not after all exactly like the average in another city. The varying extent of instruction and time given to physical education classes in different places, of course, might nullify conclusions. But within the same school these tables might be kept from year to year to observe the increase in accomplishment and development.

It is useless to try to derive any generalities concerning the number of individuals who should make a particular score, or concerning the average ability of pupils, unless the group tested is composed of considerably more than a hundred. It is also useless to apply these averages or generalities to very small groups. Therefore in arranging these tables the schools have been grouped in three classes according to size: large, medium, and small. Generalities, it is evident, can best be deduced in Class L.

Suggestions for Study of the Tables—In the Boys 100 yard dash, note that in Brockton the largest sum obtainable from adding two consecutive columns occurs with columns 8 and 7 (336 plus 274 equals 610). This shows that 61 per cent of the participants, or a good majority, were able to accomplish a performance of 12 1-5 to 13 1-5 seconds for the hundred yard

dash. The same study applied to the Holyoke records shows a similar result, as columns 8 and 7 make the highest total. Note that in other schools also this holds rather uniformly in the same columns. Hence this figure (12 1-5 to 13 1-5) might be taken as a norm for any school or a mark for a below-aver-age pupil or a never-tested pupil to aim at as a satisfactory accomplishment.

In the Boys 100-yard dash, using the two Class L schools for a comparative study, it is found that Holyoke excels Brockton in the number of boys capable of scoring 10 and 9 (that is 12 sec. or better), Holyoke having 24.9 per cent and Brockton 15.5 per cent. But at the lower end of the scale, Brockton has only 2.4 per cent who could not earn 5 points (that is, an accomplishment of 14 2-5 seconds) while Holyoke has 9.3 per cent. May it be inferred that Brockton has given class exercises in sprinting to the mass of pupils, and that Holyoke has had success in making the good runners better?

In studying the lower end of the scale, columns 2 and 1, it is evident that a score of 2 is really too simple of accomplishment; therefore the scale of measurement should be amended by making the minimum accomplishment (2 points) a little harder. With respect to the highest grade in the scale of measurement, it is evidently just right.

In the Boys High Jump, the majority accomplishment is in columns 8 and 7 in the Class L schools, and drops to columns 7 and 6 in most of the Class M schools, a fairly close agreement. The table is instructive in showing where particular schools can pay attention to developing more agility among the sluggish boys.

In the Girls High Jump it* is evident that those who can do 9 points can do 10. The 10 score is probably difficult enough. The minimum (2 points) is probably a proper height, although those schools that practise jumping seem to find it too easy. Therefore the 9 step should be omitted, and a new step should be placed between the 6 and 5.

In the Girls Basket Ball Throw, it is very evident that throwing a basketball is an exercise not universally practised by girls. Nevertheless the standard should not be lowered. A girl who cannot throw 25 feet certainly cannot throw at all; or conversely, a girl who has learned a throwing motion cannot help making 25 feet. On the other hand, a total of 46 girls made a score of 10 (throwing more than 60 feet); and 5 of these girls threw the ball over 70 feet, the very best being 74 feet.

WHAT THE OPEN AIR NURSERY SCHOOL IS.

By Margaret McMillan

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes cf wrath are stored,

He has loosed the awful lightning of his terrible swift sword,

His Truth is marching on!

He has sounded forth the trumpet that will never know retreat;

He is sifting out the Souls of men before his judgment seat,

O,	be swift my heart to answer him! Be jubilant my feet,

His Truth is marching on!

The words of a Woman’s Battle Song are at the beginning of this little pamphlet, because it is quite clear now that the Cause of the Children was won by the means that every other great cause is won, that is by suffering, courage, unfaltering and continuous attack, sacrifice—in short, war—war to the death.

No great party has as yet taken this cause much to heart. Busy as any party always is, it has had no time to spare for it, and this ‘‘busy-ness”—which in itself is no great good thing, for the Devil is busier, we are assured, than anyone else— has brought us to the twentieth century of the Christian era, when in the vanguard nation of the world, the British Empire, there is a percentage of 80 children rickety at the age of two, that is to say: in the poorer quarters about four-fifths of the whole people are damaged for life long before they are old enough to go to school.

This fact would, one might think, give us all pause, startle us, electrify us, make us stand up in horror, and send us breathless into the world to change it all at any cost. It would make, one might suppose, every candidate at every election vow himself to a campaign that would change it all within a year. Every new M. P. would be (one might swear) a new captain in this army. The Press would flame and thunder.

Note:—This Pamphlet is printed by the Joint Labour Publications department 32, 33, 34, Eccleston Square, London, S. W. 1, postage two pennies.

0 vain thought! A thousand objects claim the very close attention of the best people in the realm, so that—no! not the cry—rather the silent lapse of the children into lifelong misery and weakness, does not touch them.

Many years ago there was a stirring, a doubtful, wonder “Are you not astonished-tobe-here” kind of movement to put 1,500 London children into open-air nursery schools, and see what would come of it. It was sanctioned if not led by Moderate members of the Children’s Care Committee of the L. C.

C., who, in justice be it said, did spend £2,300 in extending one existing Open-Air Nursery School in this or the following year. The Estimates had provided, however, for an ependiture of £25,000 on this new departure In Education; and thus furnished with mandate and with money four or five members of the L. C. C. set forth in big cars to scour the poorest areas of the great city for open-air sites—a doctor, a clerk going with them to take notes and bear witness.

Dark Slums Where Babies Creep

Down into darkest London did this group of people go— to Bow, to Whitechapel, into the darker parts of St. Pan-eras, and into the black, stony, roaring wilderness that skirts all Dockland, and makes a strange dark fringe for the ever-chageful beauty of "sweet Thames.’’ They saw the dark slums where “England’s babes are creeping,” the dank and noisy hovels where they sleep in coiled heaps; the filthy lanes where they play above the noisome drains, and the great, terrible streets, whose close and heavy traffic they brave, and from which they escape—but not always—as by a miracle. This little group of people saw all that, but they could not, though they looked well, see many places where a site could he found for the planting of a new child-garden. To be sure the vile rookeries could be pulled down, but where could the sleepers in the “warrens” find shelter? So new is the demand for a decent life that former generations have built over every spot of earth in some of the poorer districts. This is not true of all our slums. Far from true. No place is so unexpected as some of the inner parts of a bad London Slum." There are places, such as Deptford (where a sturdy race of seacraft-makers oncip lived) that have even to-day great tracts of land stretching far behind the roaring streets. Few have seen them. Fewer have looked for them.

The deputation found, in spite of all, some very fair sites. They were all cleared, like oases in the midst of great rising walls of factories, huge ware-houses, new tenements, and crazy flats. They were all close to slums—hideous slums. These slums teemed with little children. In one house there were over thirty children, The members of the Care Committee, though rather doubtful, and hesitating like a child before a breaking wave, yet made up its mind to have a report, and to remind the Council of the existence of that £25,000. True,

the owners of some of the sites made things difficult, quoted old documents, and put up prices. No matter. The report got written. It was sent up to the Education Committee. It reached the full Council. The new proposal was to go forward like a craft in a storm, when crash! The Geddes Axe fell on it. In November, 1921, came a Circular from the Board of Education to declare that the money could not be spent.

The Pioneer Nursery School

The Circular, however, was too late to wreck or hold back forever the hope for the children. Already the first great worker for the Open-air Nursery School had laid down her life in Deptford. My dear sister, Rachel McMillan, died in 1917, having endured every kind of trial and run every risk to found a sample school of the new order. The school now called by her name was then, thanks to her courage and great insight, fairly at work. She died, stricken down at the close of a sad winter. Thus the full price was paid that made the future of the whole movement safe. Five months after her tragic death, on August 3, 1917, Mr. Fisher opened an extension and called the school by her name. In 1918 he placed the Open-air Nurseiy School on the Statute Book. The L. L. C. gave its first grant to the Rachel McMillan Nursery School in 1920, and now, ere the Geddes Axe had fallen, it had voted about £3,000 for the further extension of this school. The new buildings were in train, and the L. C. C., thanks largely to the help of Sir Cyril Jackson, were ready to commit themselves (against the advice of some of their chief officers) to the experiment of getting hundreds of little children together in a very new kind of school. It is now possible, years of work having passed, and reports having been made, to give the findings of this school. If I quote from the reports of only one school, it is because there is, alas! no other large Open-air Nursery School in existence.

To begin with, then, you can take a large number of little children together—say three to four hundred—and put them into such conditions that they will throw off their diseases like old garments and step forth in beauty, often in wonderful beauty. For children are made so that if they are well, and well cared for, they are very fair to look, on, beautiful, arresting to the eye and heart. You may look all over the world, and not meet such a pretty sight as the Open-air Nursery School. On this fair day in June we are in a wide and gay garden, with grass plots and noble trees, with arches covered with roses, and beds full of wandering scent, and soft radiance of flowers.

Children Playing In The Sun

Yet these are only a setting, and a dim setting for the thing that is placed here. Lo, on the the grass twenty girls and boys who have been for years in the Nursery School, acting and speaking with the charm of real artists. Of these

we must not speak here. They are another story. But see the groups of three and four-year-olds round the aviary, or at the rabbit hutches, or calling the pigeons. Hark! the two year-olds, full of life’s most vivid joys, pattering warm-footed over the sunny floors or cloistered paths of the shelters. Look at their silky hair, their sturdy limbs, and radiant eyes. And now try to remember that you are not in a West-end garden or a manor house pleasaunce!

No. You are in a slum.

The slum is all around you here like sea. These children were born here—in stained and foul warrens. Not all, to be sure. For here there are men and women who make a fair home out of very poor rooms. But not many people have such great powers. Many sink. In a dark home was born and lived that child you see here, a boy, still fragile (though no longer deformed or sullen), and who, when he was found, had been tethered to his bed like an ox, while his mother went out to earn the bottle of milk she left beside him. Certainly there shall be iio telling of such stories here. They can be found in any poor dockland or slumland street. Miss Stevinson has written a book that gives pictures of this world.

Neither shall I describe our shelters, as has been done already a hundred times. They were designed by one who loved children, and understood their needs and longings, and this is expressed in everything—in the low fencing and little gates, the open gables through which the screen of June leaves rustle, the shadowy covered way where there is always shelter from heat and rain. It is shown in the warm in-door bath-room in the wide running space secured by the oblong form of building, and on the frescoed walls and painted arches. Tender as the touch of the great Italian artist. In spite of its great humility of means, love welling from the same deep Fountain of Love as gave us all our most beautiful buildings is present here. Yes, this is beautiful! Everyone feels it who comes here. Especially artists—and mothers.

From Schools Like Prisons

Compare it with the forbidding, heavy wall of our prisonlike schools and its hard-asphalt, its shadeless space and iron gates! You will no longer doubt that these last buildings and grounds have another origin. They were an outburst of the impulse that gave us, not lovely churches, but hideous factories and satanic mills. My sister Rachel designed the first shelter. It cost £124, exclusive of the plumbing (which cost nearly £200). The form and aspect, the whole plan, in fact, has not been improved on by any later building.

The nursery-school day begins not at nine, but at eight o’clock in the	morning, and the first hour of the day is the

busiest of all, as indeed it ought to be. Picture one of our 300 mothers turning in at our gate on a bitter January morning with a toddler in her arms and a four or three year-old at her side.

She has not come far, for the children live round our teeming doors and closeby streets, but this group and others are pinched, cold, and perhaps even sleepy. Here is welcome: kind hands are stretched out to receive them here. Young girls of 18 to 25 race down the covered ways eager to welcome their babies. Grey is the sky. But the camp is bright with blue and pink overall and young rosy faces. The little ones go to their shelters, their own in-door bath-room, where is an abundance of hot as well as cold water. They are quickly overhauled, washed, dressed warmly, but with few garments, and m^de entirely comfortable, as every child should be, and is, in any good private nursery. At nine all sit down to breakfast, and at 9:30 no one cares a rap either for Jack Frost or his brother, Snow. The toddlers’ camp rings with laughter and the tripping of little feet, while close to the cheerful glowing fires the new-comers gather so as to get over their first notion that one must be cold because the barometer is down.

“Twos on a Monday morning

When I beheld my darling

She looked so neat and charming in every kind of way

It is one of our students singing

Lo! grave little two-year-olds a-caper round the young girl, who sings till everyone is dancing.

School In The Garden

On the tables and along the walls there is apparatus of varied kinds,	coloured	discs, coloured balls, insets

colour scales, bright letters to be fitted, pictures and picture-books. Outside there are sliding boards, steps, and rib stalls. All the best apparatus is in the garden. We lose some of it in winter, but not all. The tiny two-year-old works hard. He and she have so much to learn. It is hard to stop him. At twelve there is a two-course dinner, with two-year-old monitors serving, and at 12:30 300 little ones are fast asleep.

There are few days in the year when the Sun God does not come for a while, and always, winter or summer, morning or afternoon, we let Him bring His great healing and joy to our children. That is their birthright. Here it is restored to them. All the afternoon, and on fine mornings, they are playing, working, sleeping where He can find them. This is the great source of our rapid cures. Within a year all our cases of rickets are cured. There is no more anaemia. No more cark threat of death, and of something worse than death. At 5 to 5:30, -after the evening meal, a long line of mothers and elder sisters come up the cloisters to fetch the children. With what joy and wonder does many a woman clasp her child, noting the glow of health in cheek and eye,"and the passing of every sad and stubborn trace of long weakness and misery.

If the toddler is mentioned here it is because he is the only rickety child. The others are cured, If at three years old or four any of our children have rickets still, we have failed.

But the medical officers say we have not failed. They note the results in their reports. “No trace of rickets after one year’s attendance at this school.” This repdrt is open for the public to note if the public wished to note such things. The public is not much interested as yet, else there would be no local authority in this country who would dare to hesitate in replacing the infant school of to-day by the open-air nursery school of tomorrow.

Revolution In Education

How Carlyle would have thundered over these 80 per cent, rickety children. He did not know of them, for even in his day the most startling facts lay safe, unearthed, like buried powder under mighty guns. Yet this fact, so terrible and yet so near the surface of things that a bold effort would hunt it out of existence in a year is, nevertheless, not so simple as it appears. It is related not merely to a part, but to the whole of our educational system. Thus when we want to deal with it we cannot fall back on precedent. We cannot say,“We will build as for the infant school of to-day,” for that kind of building is out of date; or “We shall staff as for the elementary-school, but with smaller classes,” for that kind of staffing will not do, however we reduce our “classes” (as we call them).

In order to do our duty to all rickety toddlers we must think not only of our infant schools but of our secondary schools; and not of our elementary schools alone, but of our colleges and our college system. I hope to write of every one of these places of learning—but not here.

Even here we may put a question.

Where are our colleges—the places where the young people are trained who will go out to educate the millions? Some of them are very beautiful places. Away out at Eltham, for example, where a rich man had built himself a splendid home, a house of marble halls, all embowered in rose gardens and sweeping lawns, and with noble trees keeping watch over all this pleasaunce of 14 acres, there is now a college of two to three hundred girls who will soon become teachers in schools. How do these girls live during their years of training? Well, • to begin with, Tike many other students, they are carried far, far away from the scene of their future work. They must teach for a few weeks, in an elementary school, but their college years are passed in a beautiful place, that is beautiful largely because there are no streets or crowded places near. “Here you must study hard,” say the Authorities. “Read learn, mark, attend to your	lecturers, and	enjoy	the beautiful gardens,	the

fine view from	the windows.	You	will like to think of	it,”

say the kind Governors, “when you are far away.”

The Teacher Looks Ahead

This was true of pre-war girls. It is not true of the girl of to-day. She	loves beauty perhaps	more than girls of earlier

days. But this	love is linked	now	to another. It meets	and

merges in the rising hope of youth—the hope and desire to find Life's real meaning and mission. She actually wants to find her life work, and to wade right into the middle of her problems as a way of getting to grips with them while she is young. “These sad, anaemic, nurseless little children,” she says in her own way, “I am going to deal with them, to cure them, to save them, to give them the fine things that the well-to-do child has already as its right. Not mere lessons, not mere play even, and dismissal into I know not what at 12 o’clock and 4.”

In the teacher of yesterday this bold and soaring hope was not born. Or if she knew it she knew it as quenched in the rising, she could not guarantee even the minimum of nurture. But the girls of Britain are going to guarantee this minimum to every child of mine. Above all, the new teacher will do this. She says of any child: “He has a home. I shall go there. He is on a public-house step at 10 p. m. I shall be there, too. He is dirty. I must wash him. Stupid and tired? I must see that he sleeps at night. Rickety? He must live under new conditions all the day. Books? Lectures Yes, I must have them. But what is it that will make these live for me? Where is my workshop? My human beings who are to be the sole material on which I shall have to work? The cloister will do for the bookworms. My college must be close to my children.”

Learning To Teach

Strange! It no sooner becomes clear that she wants this than we see that the sacrifice will not be great. She may still live among the rustling trees and riotous roses. These will grow and bloom in any child-garden in the heart of any slum. Neither must we give Up scholarship. No! A girl does the work of a nurse for two hours daily in her first terms, just as a doctor works, or as any apprentice to a skilled trade must work. What she learns in the bathroom and nursery gives life and meaning to all her study in psychology, and lends her mind a grasp and vision of reality that the student of yesterday could not reach. There is something one cannot learn from books. Stephenson learned it when he oiled his own engines. We begin to understand that teachers, too, learn only by work. Everyone talks about the “parrot-learning,” that takes account only of exams. Here is the real work, the deep, great, human interest that will sweep any girl into higher reaches than the mere desire for poor success can win. And the authorities know it! The Board of Education now pays the same grant for students taking their student course of the first year in a Nursery Training Centre, as it pays to the older colleges. We owe much to the Home and Colonial College, which became our first colleague. It takes the Rachel McMillan students for the second year of their Board of Education training courses. The Board of Education finds that this co-operation does not spoil the student’s work, but that the student gains by the practical work. Large and stately colleges are not what is
703

needed most to-day. No new college should be too large or take in more than, say, 100. And these new small colleges should be built in the heart of the crowded quarters of the cities—near the swarming streets, close to the homes and life of the children. Each of these colleges should serve two or three or even more large Nursery Schools. In the Shelters every student would work, not for a few weeks, but for at least two years, giving a shift time of two to three hours daily, varying this with a sleeping shift sometimes. Thus a girl would get to know many great things of which no hint is given her in present day training colleges. Take for example, this opportunity of observing daily how children, of various types, pass into the dim world of sleep, there is no one who does not reveal new truths to the watcher then. Nothing is more wonderful than “a sleeping shift.” To see 300 children sleeping in the open is to get a glimpse through the lattice of the infinite —to win a new kind of light on many things.

Vicarious Motherhood

Even these colleges will not be enough to fill the vast nurseries of the people (who hitherto have had no nurses but overworked, anxious, poor, and often over-tired mothers.) At the door wait thousands of girls who need not and will not enter the teachers' Trade Union or market, will not compete or undersell, but might work with the teacher, learn from her, and enrich even her student days by their friendship. Trades Unionism need not, and should not, cry out before it is threatened or hurt. Many girls do not want to be teachers. They want rather to be nurses, doctors, public health officers, or even mothers. They may be women anxious to serve better in homes or elsewhere. To them the teacher’s post will not be given. We shall have at the head of every Shelter only a trained teacher. It will be part of her work to train, and teach those outside helpers. But to say (as some do) that the N. U. T. will not allow the girl from without to learn or to work that is tyranny and folly also. For without this kind of help the new teacher will herself be helpless. She will have to go back to her classes of 50 or 60, as the case may be, and let all nurture go again by the board.

The first great College to come forward with a new plan is Avery Hill, at Eltham. Miss Hawtrey, the Principal, is sending her students out from their enchanted gardens into Bermondsey and Deptford, and for the last two years she has taken 100 of the older children of the Rachel McMillan Camp into the beautiful hostel and gardens for the month of August. Is not that a fine gesture? I see in it the end of the slum. Its doom is read. Its knell is rung. It is proposed now to fill one hostel of Avery Hill College with free-lance student non-teacher girls, so that the teachers and helpers will be ready when the call comes, as come it must. This great love and active help was not won for the movement by our Nursery

School children. It was the older children who are above five years old, and have been through the Nursery School, and left it years ago, these have won the help of Avery Hill and the sympathy of other colleges. For these older children (our Camp children) are of striking beauty, and are, according to the Reports of L. C. C. inspectors and of Board of Education inspectors, also of striking intelligence and charm. They are a kind of first fruits of the new order. Plucked as it were in storm, dashed by heavy rain and doubtful weather, unsteady a little, perhaps, in some of their gains, bearing some faint trace of old scars and failures, but very fair, with a strange loveliness, a wistful and triumphant beauty. Having known them it was desired to know how they came to be what they are. The Open-air Nursery School made them. “Then let us make more,” cried the Principal of one College. “Let us make so many that the world will be filled with lovely beings.” For, after all, the aim of Education Colleges and even Parliament is just this—that the earth may be filled with lovely, happy, and wise people.

These dark, dread slums cannot be wiped out by the building of new houses. New homes must be built. Do we not know it well? But the new life that is to grow in the new home must be given something more than new shelter. It must live where it can grow. What has damned out people in the past is only this—they could not grow. They had no nurseries.

Children Who Could Not Grow.

There was no money to grow human health, intelligence, and power. Once given a chance of real growth' this Human Power, inspired by Higher Powers yet, can settle every kind of problem, financial and otherwise. It can change the very nature of the work that has be to done. It offers new duties to everyone—even to Ministers of Health and Labour. There was no money to grow it The great, the awful blunder of yesterday is that the children were not allowed to grow up. They were spent in order that other kinds of wealth should he made and hoarded. And what folly it is even from the low standpoint of material output. For that is not anything like what it should be after all. “But to fit people out like that and make them well, will be a great expense to start with,” says a Voice. Why, no. The Open-air Nursery School costs less	than	the Infant School	to-day.	The comptroller	cannot

find	that	it costs more than	£14	per	annum to keep	a child

there. Even the zealous critic who reminds us that no rent is paid for a part of this school cannot make out his case. Full	rent	and rates are paid	for	120	children who are	not on

this	site at all, and 80 of these	are	over five years old. If,

as we hope, a new shelter can soon be added, the average cost will fall below £14. In Dundee, the Glen Agnes Open-air Nursery School, for which Miss Mabel Brydie laid down her life,

the jute worker mothers paid the whole cost of the school, save only the teacher’s salaries.

The history of the Scottish pioneer school is much shorter than is the history of the Rachel McMillan Nursery and Training Centre. The latter was a long struggle. It is but four years since the Principal of the Scottish school ended her training here and began her work in Dundee. In two and a half years the bitter struggle was ended—she died in 1922, a victim to blood poisoning. Yet before she gave her life Mabel Brydie had sent her challenge (heard or unheard) throughout Scotland. Never while a child dies or lives there in a dark cellar, or a fetid yard, will that brave voice be quite silenced. For she not only made these wee Scottish bodies well, she uncovered the strength and valour of their souls. She visited these dens called homes. She told how babies lived and died, only by gaslight, without ever having perhaps seen the sun. She worked with all her failing powers to rouse people to a sense of what this means. She went to the School Board, talked to inspectors, and tried to enlist the people who move things in Dundee and in Scotland, worked and died. No Scotsman can ever read her pamphlet without longing to join the war for new homes and nurseries in Scotland.

Such very precious children are they, too—the handful that is plucked like brands from the fire, typical of the many who are not gathered out of the burning, but are left there. These were not, I say, as English children, fair as the wild rose in the June hedge-rows. They were little Scots, dour and keen to do their own work. “I can do it masel,” the refrain always, when help was offered. Looking out at the new world beyond the gas-lit cavern, with growing astonishment, one little boy, taken for the first time into an omnibus, gazes at the faces of the passengers, with solemn and inquiring eyes. Not chained to work all day then! The world is not all mills and dark rooms. ‘Why is na everybody in the mills?” he asks in awe-struck tones. Another, having been taken away in the country, in sight of hills and sparkling sea and woodland, fixes great wondering dark eyes on his teacher, looks, but utters no word for a long time. Then, in low, hushed accents, asks a question, “Whaur does God abide?” says he. There are thousands of just such little people in the gas-lit dens of Dundee. Theirs, too, is the metaphysical brain that grapples early with big questions, as distinct from other types, equally precious, but different. If they are nursed, and fed, and washed, and loved, and sent forth into the light (as the Nursery School would lead and feed them) they, too, would put forth their native power, would show themselves, like the silver thistles of their own rugged and lovely country—the thistles that are like no other flower of the field. But now they have the same look as the neglected child of any place wears —in Deptford, in Bradford, in Dundee. For misery has one

Google
706

face in early childhood, one dumb and hopeless aspect. In Scot or Saxon it is all the same.

Nurture for All

Neither the English nor the Scottish have yet set out to give nurture to all their children. They have asked for schools and for a certain amount of schooling, and Sir George Newman and others tell us what they have got as the result of 54 years’ schooling. It is clear that they have got something, but this education, which is now free to all, is always kept down to a certain level; first, because the parents are for the most part too poor to let the children carry on at school long enough to achieve real victory; and also because, long before he goes to school, the child of the people is handicapped by the risks he has run and the losses that have befallen him in his earliest years. Poor children as well as rich children need nurture.

“Well! the mother can give it,” cry many hard and careless voices. “If she stays at home she can do all that is needed.” This is not true. She cannot do all that is needed. Her well-to-do sister cannot do it. Neither does she attempt it. We are being asked every day to let our trained teacher-nurses go into wealthy homes—homes that have every comfort and that are presided over by good mothers.

But we do not want to send them there. Neither do they wish to go. For they have heard the cry of the children and the mothers that have no helpers.

Equality does not begin in the school. It begins in the nursery. The word has gone forth. “Nurture for all.” However that voice may be overborne, however long it may be ignored, it will break forth again like a strain of heavenly music. For this was the battle-cry of the great lovers who fell; who fell when their work was done.

SPORTSMANSHIP EDUCATION

Milton Fairchild, Washington, D. C.

In order to get stimulation and guidance for charactei development out of the sports in public schools, it will be wise to organize this part of the character education work in your schools around the ideals of sportsmanship. These ideals are of long standing in human society and have behind them experience and established public sentiment. For the purpose of the visual lesson in sportsmanship the following code was formulated:

Note—'All persons interested in this subject will please write to Character Education Institution, 3770 McKinley St., N. W., Chevy Chase, Washington, D. C.

Digitized by Tooele
707

Law 1. Sport for sport’s sake.

Law 2. Play the game within the rules.

Law 3. Be courteous and friendly in your games.

Law 4. A sportsman must have courage.

Law 5. The umpire shall decide the play.

Law 6. Honor for the victors, but not derision for the

vanquished.

Law 7. The true sportsman is a good loser in his games.

Law 8. The sportsman may have pride in his success but not conceit.

In order to get character development from school sports, these ideals of sportsmanship will have to be thoroughly inculcated. By the word “inculcated” I mean that the pupils will have to be given a thorough understanding of these ideals, and of the experience and argumentation which justifies them, and of the strength of public sentiment which supports them. In addition they will have to be persuaded and influenced to be loyal to their discussions and sentiments regarding episodes that arise. This loyalty must be educated to tJie point where it constitutes a positive resolve to keep the laws of sport, and this resolve must work itself through into the realm of habit, so that practice conforms to intellectual appreciation of sportsmanship and also to the resolve to fulfill sportsmanship. A portion of the whole work to be done is instruction in sportsmanship but the larger portion is the stimulation of loyalty and the guidance of practice.

For character education in sportsmanship in the typical school system there needs to be arranged a means of control over school sports by school officials who are sportsmanlike through and through in their own personalities. There should be a central committee of sportsmanship appointed by the superintendent which will have the supervision of the school sports from the standpoint of sportsmanship without executive responsibility. It should be the right and duty of this committee to sanction the membership of the various school teams from the standpoint of sportsmanship and to debar any candidate who is not a true sportsman in his athletics. It should be the right of this committee to discard any game which in its judgment has been won by unsportsmanlike conditions. This committee on sportsmanship should have the right also to cancel

the appointment of any coach or the election of any captain for lack of sportsmanship. The authority of this committee on sportsmanship should be derived through the superintendent from the board of education, which board should sanction the code of sportsmanship and require its fulfillment of those who receive a salary in whole or in part for their work in athletics. The ground taken should be as follows:

That a good American citizen has to be sportsmanlike in his home and social life, and his politics, in his business or professional life and in all his life as a citizen, therefore it is essential that the public school develop this trait of character in the

Digitized by

Google
708

children of the Nation, and that this phase of character education is the most vital objective for school sports. From the standpoint of education it should be declared that it is important that the play be skillful, intelligent, vigorous, helpful and sportsmanlike. Those who are employed to supervise the school sports should be required to be loyal to this standard of values.

The central committee of sportsmanship should have a sub-committee of three in each school; this committee should include the principal, one teacher and probably one pupil. Great care should be taken to exclude from membership on the general committee on sportsmanship and from the school committees all persons who as coaches, trainers, etc., have a financial income from their work in athletics and whose tenure of position is favorably or unfavorably influenced by the success or failure of school teams to win games. The membership on these committees of sportsmanship should not be from those who are involved in the development of skill. They should be from those who are true amateurs in their relations to sport, and who represent the educational objectives of the school.

The above statement applies chiefly to arrangements that are needed for the enforcement of sportsmanship. In addition there ought to be arrangements for the inculcation of sportsmanship and also for the practice of sportsmanship.

The laws of sportsmanship, outlined above, should be printed in large type and distributed to all the schools to be posted in some conspicuous place as an expression of the standard of sportsmanship for schools. Lectures and discussions should be arranged for, especially in the elementary schools in order that a definite and positive understanding of the argument from experience which justifies these laws of good sportsmanship may be clearly understood by all. The best possible way to teach sportsmanship is from lantern slides made from instantaneous pnotographs taken of the episodes in athletic events which illustrate the eight great laws of sportsmanship. These lantern slides can be collected from the athletic photographs made by newspapers. It is just as necessary to have concrete material in teaching sportsmanship as in other subjects. This instruction should be given with special enthusiasm in the sixth and seventh grades of elementary schools in order to circumvent the forming of unsportsmanlike habits. The boy who has no interest in being a sportsman in his games should be discovered and barred from school sports as early as possible in his athletic career. It will be much easier to persuade him to be loyal to sportsmanship before he has contracted bad habits. The episodes which take place in school sports which are creditable from the standpoint of sportsmanship should be used as the basis for enthusiastic praise and congratulations. Unsportsmanlike conduct should be condemned publicly before the entire school, accompanied by a repetition of the standard of sportsmanship which was violated and of the argument

Digitized by

Google
709

which justifies the standard. The effort should be thoroughly convincing and also it should awaken loyalty to the ideals of sportsmanship.

There will be little accomplished in the character development of any boy or girl who does not participate in the practice of sportsmanship. The committee on sportsmanship might do its work admirably and the inculcation of the ideals of true sport might be enthusiastic and intelligent, and yet very little result be achieved in character development on the part of the pupils without experience of the emotional strain involved in being true sportsmen under trying circumstances. It seems to me that a very broad program of sports should be organized for the high schools and for the elementary schools and that every boy and every girl should be expected to take part in some way in some sport. The physical education department would be justified in requiring that every boy and every girl select and participate in some athletic undertaking unless excused for good reasons. The chief justification in this universal participation in sports lies in the character development which will result. It is surely worth while organizing for education in sportsmanship even though comparatively small numbers of pupils actually take part in school sports, but the great gain to be gotten from athletics in the field of character development cannot be achieved unless there is quite universal participation in athletics.

IV. THE LAW OF SPORTSMANSHIP

(From Children’s Morality Code for Elementary Schools.)

Good Americans Play Fair

Strong play increases and trains one’s strength and courage.

Sportsmanship helps one to be a gentleman, a lady. Therefore:

1.	I will not cheat; I will keep the rules, but I will play the game hard, for the fun of the game, to win by strength and skill. If I should not play fair, the loser would lose the fun of the game, the winner would lose his self-respect, and the game itself would become a mean and often cruel business.

2.	I will treat my opponents with courtesy, and trust them if they deserve it. I will be friendly.

3.	If I play in a group game, I will play, not for my own glory, but for the success of my team.

4. I will be a good loser or a generous winner.

5. And in my work as well as in my play, I will be sportsmanlike—generous, fair, honorable.

FROM FOREIGN EDUCATION JOURNALS O

A NEW TRAINING COURSE FOR WOMEN AT WYK.

Margarete Faeber, Berlin, Neukoelln,

Translated from “Physical Education” by Dr. D. V. Besser,

The exponents of the physical and mental advancement of women have for some time considered starting courses in physical education exclusively for women. When the fact became known that such a course would be given at Wyk on the island of Foehr in the North Sea it was received with enthusiasm by all women interested in the physical welfare of their sex.

Whoever expects to gain physical strength by outdoor life and bodily exercises will rejoice with me that Dr. Gmelin’s Sanatorium and Health Resort was selected for the training quarters. In the summer of 1919 I had the opportunity to visit the place. The large park with its many shade trees, warm and cold sea baths, resting places along the shore, tennis courts, playgrounds and recreation centers make the sanatorium an ideal spot for our purpose........

Our course opened with 84 participants. They came from all parts of Germany. Most of them are teachers. Some have come to acquaint themselves with more modem ideas in physical instructions, others to gain a vocational training and some to strengthen impaired health. The ages range from 16 to 55.

The faculty was confronted with several problems. To furnish proper accommodations for so many was one. The arrangements for the course of study and the outline for the practical work was another. The difference in ages and the mental and physical qualifications of the participants had to be considered. .........

The following is a tentative program of the daily work: 7:15 A. M. Breakfast; 8:15 A. M. Calisthenics and Apparatus work; 10 A. M. Observation of Model Classes of School Children in Physical Training; 11 A. M. Light Athletics at the Recreation Centers. 12 M. Lecture on Theory of Gymnastics, Hygiene or Pedagogy. 1 P. M. Dinner; 2-3 P. M. Rest Period; 3-5:30

P.	M. Massage, Athletics and Gymnastics. 5:30- 6:30 Lecture, 7 P. M. Supper. On some evenings Folk dancing and singing form part of the program. The Wednesday and Saturday afternoons are reserved for Swimming, Bathing and Hiking. * * * If one considers our daily work and the peculiar influence the climatic conditions of the North Sea assert upon the body it is not surprising that when evening comes every one is anxious to retire. * * *

The fact that there is a demand for physical education for women can not be denied, when we consider the number who enrolled. The ability in the practical work among the participants varies greatly. * * * To avoid criticism the faculty has tried blending the old and new systems of physical education, thereby not exhibiting too much optimism for either one. Common sense should determine what kinds of activities may be retained or eliminated to be of real value in the development of the female body * * * To promote mutual interest on all topics of our daily work, clubs were organized. Hardly any new form of teaching has been demonstrated since the course began. Perhaps the faculty will commence later with the more progressive forms. The lectures on anatomy, physiology, biology and personal hygiene are parts of the second half of the course. I think this is a mistake. In my opinion those branches ought to be taught before the practical work, or should progress with it. * * The climatic conditions and the physical work seem to benefit the health of all women taking part in the course. There is a record of a general increase in weight. I am of the opinion that Wyk could be made of more service as a health resort for the physical education of adolescence. The stimulating effect of the climate of the North Sea ip favorable to the natural development of girls passing from girlhood to mental and physical maturity. * * It is too early at present to give a summary of the course, because not half of the time has expired. ***** We women thank Dr. Franz Kirchberg and the German University of Gymnastics for the arrangement of this training course. It is a splendid effort to popularize physical training among women and to promote their health.

News, notes and comments

«> 1 ♦

As the academic year ends with the muffled thunder from commencement platforms rolling on the June horizons, there are echoes of the perennial conflict between athletics of the mind and athletics of the muscle. Both factions have their champions now, as they have always had, with their zealotry unbated.

Dr. Frederick Wettstone, president of Dubuque University contends athletics have been more a liability than an asset. He announces all sports will be dropped indefinitely in his school of 160 students and twenty-eight instructors.

Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, president of one of the Carnegie foundations, fired the first salvo in this battle of 1925 back in March, when he wrote:

“Today the outside activities of the college overshadow and run counter to the intellectual life. Athletics, in large measure

Google
712

professional in their methods and organization, fill a larger place in the eyes of the student and even of the public than any other one interest. No scholar in the undergraduate life of one of our university-colleges would expect to receive the recognition or appreciation given to a successful football player.* * The college is no longer a distinctively intellectual agency.”

How familiar are these wails from the cloistered quadrangles and classrooms! Yet the serene sweep of college activities on field, river, track and diamond goes smoothly on. It ought to be apparent to the more or less closeted souls of chapel and study that the American youth and the American spirit do not intend the college to be a ‘‘distinctively intellectual agency.” A people’s institutions are about what they will them to be, colleges included and savants to the contrary notwithstanding.

The majority opinion is better shown by the recent statement of Prof. Mondell, chairman of the Yale University Board of Control and probable next dean. He sees this scholastic day as one of required curriculums battling against the dangers of unrestricted selectives, overspecialization and a general tendency to V scattering” intellectualism. In this confusion he holds "athletics make education safe for the undergraduate.”

Dubuque University, with its 160 students, was founded in 1862. Yale, with 4131 stundets, 490 instructors, dates back to 1701. Mostly it is the small college that tries to keep up the hopeless fight against the trend of the times. In all the greater institutions the pale Athene moved over and made room for the wing-heeled Mercury long, long ago.

However, this sputtering war goes on inside and around the fringes of the colleges. It started early this year and is lasting longer than usual. It was in April that Prof. Mahin, Purdue University, scandalized the Western conference by demanding an "absolute divorcement” of higher education from all athletics. His were bitter words:

"Intercollegiate sport is now on a professional basis* *	*

the homecoming of football teams is made the occasion of gambling and liquor-drinking debauches *	*	* football is played

in a way detrimental to the health and soundness of the players and a menace to their lives.”

Prof. Mahin straightway disappeared under a swarming mass of his critics and his voice was heard no more. His brethren of the classroom deserted him in battalions. Every college that ever had a hojnecoming or a team turned on him, demanding proofs. His was the fate of nearly every crusader who breaks a lance in the effort to turn the colleges back to the intellectual corrals of Yesterday.

The times are too much for this monastic view of education. The public and the average undergraduate are convinced that a trained mind in a trained body is better than a trained mind in an untrained body. We are the most athletic folk of the
713

world. At times we are inclined to make fools of ourselves over a pugilist, a home-run hitter, a golfer or a half-back. Such as we are, however, we are.

It is natural and inevitable that our colleges should mirror this phase of Americanism. Doubtless they always will. It is well to have a few professors and savants ready to protest and lead the way to reforms and restrictions that may be needed, but they will never be able to lead American education and youth back into the musty cloisters from which they have right royally escaped.

Philadelphia Legder.

The New York World has the following notice:

FOUND guilty of bad posture, improper shoes or other foot defects, 150 girls at the Colorado Agricultural College have been sentenced to learn a new game, “How to play marbles with your toes,” by the physical education department as a corrective exercise.

Miss Vera Barger, who arrived from China recently reports slow moving but drastic changes affecting the physical freedom of Chinese girls. "Chinese boxing is often the only form of physical education that Chinese schools give,” she said. “ Chinese girls are enthusiastic about the innovation of physical education, folk dancing, drills and gymnastics introduced by the Y. W. C. A.

Miss Barger is national educational director of the work of the Y. W. C. A. in China. Nearly eighty per cent of the girls have a struggle with the family in order to attend the Y. W. C. A. Normal School of Physical Education now merged with Ginling College, Miss Barger added. The older generation still thinks it is more ladylike for girls to take tiny steps and to be frail and flowerlike. "I was considered a model child for I sat all day and never ran or played,” said a Chinese woman. "I realize now what I am paying for it in ill-health. I want my daughters to be well and strong.”

‘‘We preach health in all its aspects to the girls,” continued Miss Barger. “Chinese girls wear a costume that in itself is comfortably loose) but they wear chestbinders to flatten their chests.”

A HEALTHY PERSONALITY

Have you a healthy personality? You can check yourself up by the eleven standards of mental, emotional, moral and social health given in the recent report of Joint Committee on Health Problems in Education of the National Education Association and the American Medical Association.

Although the evidences of a healthy personality given by the Joint Committee apply to school children, they are equally

Digitized by

Google
714

applicable to adults, allowing for a variety and range of individual differences. They are given as follows:

1.	The child possesses intelligence adequate to meet the demands of his life. This includes the whole range of intelligence from very superior to somewhat below average. Some very healthy personalities are found among those whose intelligence is inferior to the average but is nevertheless sufficient to meet the demands of simple lives of manual work.

2. He is able to concentrate his attention on the matter before him and to perceive the important elements of the situation with accuracy and alertness.

3.	He is interested in the world about him and curious to understand it.

4.	He is generally self-confident; he expects success and achieves it with reasonable frequency.

5.	He is active in overcoming difficulties; he does not “day dream” so much that he fails to meet the actual situation.

6.	His predominating emotional qualties are happiness, cheerfulness, courageousness. He is not troubled by unnecessary fears, shyness or timidity. His emotional responses -are those that are appropriate and useful for the occasion.

7.	He does not ordinarily brood or sulk, or indulge in morbid introspection.

8.	He has many objective interests, friends, hobbies, games in which he finds adequate self-expression.

9.	He is companionable and mingles easily with other children. He adapts himself easily to cooperative enterprises; to leadership or to followership.

10.	His relationsips with children of the opposite sex are wholesome.

11.	He has a sense of responsibility for the happiness and well being of his friends, schoolmates and members of his family.

To be well balanced, the report states, it is not necessary to suppress one’s individual qualities or to conform to a uniform pattern. Nevertheless, the above are the simplest and most significant evidences of a healthy personablity.—Hygeia.

Civilization has outgrown the old schools, the old curriculum and old methods. Modern civilization demands new methods and requires a new curriculum. It demands actual living in the school rooms. Only thus can you get the unassignable things. No canned curriculum will suffice. It must be made “on the spot” as it is needed and must be the joint work of teacher and pupil. It demands a teacher who can do it and who is free to do it. It demands a school different from those which commonly exist. Intelligent and responsible teaching is the only key to the situation. This places a great responsibility on the teachers, but they can meet it. Some can now. They only need to be freed. More could learn, if given a chance under wise supervision. They need encouragement, practice, and guidance.—Wm. H. Kirkpatrick, Ph. D.
