U.	S. ARMY PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS.

A Compilation by William A. Stecher, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Bulletin No. 3 of the War Department dated March 17, 1923 outlines a test in track and field work that is to be used in the Citizens Military Training Camps.

To stimulate the greatest amount of interest, says the bulletin, and that the greatest benefit from them may be had, the competitive side of these tests should be stressed, especially, and the greatest amount of publicity given to them. To encourage interest in the events, ail candidates dunng the first week of camp should be fully informed with respect to them, that they

are to be considered as a national yardstick for measuring the relative physical standards of young men in various parts of the country, and that, subsequent to the camps, it is contemplated to give the greatest publicity to the results, announcing not only the camp obtaining the highest results • but also the winning State and the department or corps area as shown by results obtained in all camps, Reserve Officers Training Corps and Citizens Military Training, conducted in any one department or corps area. The tests will be conducted but once for each camp, preferably during the last week thereof, and the greatest care will be taken to insure fairness of competition and accuracy of results and records made.

In order that the results obtained may be an accurate index of the standards of physical efficiency, it is desirable that participation be as nearly complete as possible, and to this end camp commanders, conducting tests, will require that every member of the camp present on the day in question and not actually on sick report shall participate. All students will participate in each event. No special athletic uniform will be allowed; spiked running shoes are barred. All men will compete in usual field uniform, service shoes, leggins, breeches, flannal shirt, hats or caps not required; no equipment required.

In addition to conducting these contests at the summer training camps heretofore enumerated, department and corps area commanders are urged to add these to all their physical training programs, field meets and competitions, to the end that not only the entire personnel of organizations in individual posts, camps, and stations may compete for the highest standard in one any camp, but also that the post, State, and camp having the highest standard in any one department or corps area may be determined.

The fundamental purpose of these standard efficiency tests is an effort to raise the physical standards of the youth of this country and to initiate action which will result in eradicating many of the numerous physical defects which exist in our young men.

Department and corps area commanders will, therefore, bring these physical efficiency tests to the attention of all the Reserve Officers Training Corps units, both senior and junior, under their jurisdiction, and suggest that these institutions arrange to carry out these competitions some time during the coming year. Interest in this event may be stimulated by favorable publicity and announcing for each department and corps area the junior and senior unit establishing the highest standard in the tests.

In order to insure equal conditions of competition the rules herein stated as to uniform of contestants should be adhered to. Special athletic dress and spiked running shoes should be barred.

C.	Suggested rules for conducting meet rapidly and efficiently.

One hundred yard dash:—1. Align all contestants in columns of files 6 feet apart on any level field. Put not more than 20 men in each column. As many columns may be used as the ground and the number of judges permit.

2.	Run all the first men in each column of files in the first heat, the second men in the columns in the second heat, continuing rapidly until all contestants have run.

3.	Have a judge for each lane or column who acts as scorer.

4.	Use but one stop watch. The start of the race is signaled by a revolver shot. The completion of 114-5 seconds is marked by a second revolver shot. Each judge determines the position of the contestant in his lane when the shot signaling the completion of 114-5 seconds is fired. According to the number of lanes and columns, the judge for each column takes position where he can best determine the location of the man in his lane at the second revolver shot. Running lanes should be laid off as per diagram herewith. This diagram shows the number of points scored by each man according to his position in his lane at the completion of 11 4-5 seconds.

Men on or beyond this line at end of 114-5 seconds score 100 points.

100 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 11 4-5 seconds score 90 points.

97 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 11 4-5 seconds score 80 points.

94 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 11 4-5 seconds score 70 points.

91 yards—------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 114-5 seconds score 60 points.

88 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 114-5 seconds score 50 points.

85 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 11 4-5 seconds score 40 points.

82 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 114-5 seconds score 30 points.

79 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men in this space at end of 114-5 seconds score 20 points.

76 yards-------------------------------------------------------

Men not inside the 76 yd. line at end of 11 4-5 sec. score 10 points.

Running High Jump:—1. Keep the same alignment judges and group as for the 100 yard dash.

2.	Arrange each column in one lane with eight high-jump standards set as follows:

First			3 ft.	2
Second			3	6
Third					3	10
Fourth			4	2
Fifth 			4	4
Sixth 			4	6
Seventh 			4	8
Eighth'1			4	10

Standards should be set far enough apart to allow contestant the required run before the “take-off”. Have each man in each column run through its respective lane, trying each height. The best jump made by each man counts.

Note.—It is assumed that all contestants can clear at least

3	feet, 2 inches; men who do not clear 3 feet 2 inches score 20 points.

Running Broad Jump.—1. Keep the same alignment judges and group as in previous events.

2.	Arrange for each column to jump rapidly in its own lane. Mark on the sides the eight distances from the “take-off” for which points are scored—that is, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ana 17 feet. This method obviates all necessity of measuring each individual jump. Three trials are allowed each contestant with the best jump only counting. Usual rules with reference to running broad jump govern as regards fouls.

Note.—Men who jump less than 10 feet score 20 points.

Bar Vault.—1. Keep the same alignment judges and group as in previous events.

2.	Arrange for each column eight bar vault standards, set at

4	feet, 4 feet 4 inches, 4 feet 8 inches, 5 feet, 5 feet 2 inches, 5 feet 4 inches, 5 feet 6 inches, and 5 feet 8 inches.

3.	Failure to clear a height on one continuous motion on one trial loses the vault. The contestant has but one try at all heights, the best vault only to count.

Note.—Men who vault less than 4 feet score 20 points.

4.	A simple method of arranging for the bar vault is to place a 2-1-4 inch galvanized iron pipe in groove in top of 3 by 4 inch joists set in the ground at eight heights. Joists may be braced by driving stakes into the ground diagonally, and nailing them to joists. For rapid work eight bars should be arranged for each 20 men. If the group is divided into four squads, one for each event, then eight bars for each forty men will be adequate.

General suggestions:—1. Keep each column of files grouped together throughout the entire contest with the same judges.

2.	Have a chief scorer for the contest, with a chief scorer for each event, and an assistant for each event for each 60 men.

3.	Have score sheets for each event made out for each column of^files group, with space for recording each man’s record. Number each column.

4.	Have assistant scorers collect from the column of files scorers immediately all sheets for an event, turning them into the chief scorer.

5.	Number conspicuously each column of files score sheet, keeping the same number for each event.

6.	The column groups may all compete at the same time in an event, or, to save equipment, the class may be divided into four groups with enough sub-divisions in each group to complete the contest rapidly.

A STUDY OF THE PHYSICAL ABILITY OF MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN

Samuel J. Judelsohn, Philadelphia.

The mentally retarded or backward child is receiving more special attention now than ever before in Philadelphia and special types of physical education are given in the different classes. The problem at hand deals with the boy and girl found in the special class concentration centers. A large part of the time in these

special classes is devoted to physical training (about 30 minutes per day). Approximately one-third of this time is devoted to track and field work. This gives rise to the following questions:

1.	What are the results (in actual measurements) of the participation of the mentally retarded child in this type of physical education?

2.	How does the mentally retarded child compare with the normal child in track and field ability?

For a number of years courses of study in physical education have contained certain track and field events, and the performances have been tabulated and standards have been set up (see references below). The selection of these events in Philadelphia is based upon the four fundamental and primitive activities of jumping, throwing, climbing and running. In selecting the specific events one viewpoint was that of bringing into play large muscle groups; another, to make the events of a vigorous type; another, to make them interesting, and, another, to use events requiring the use of only ordinary equipment, if any at all. The four activities selected were the Standing Broad Jump, Ball Throw Overhead, 50 Yard Dash, and Chinning for boys and Knee Raising for Girls. After placing these events in use records were gathered and definite Age Aims were established. With constant practice and more attention devoted to physical education these aims had to be revised from time to time. The normal classes have thus been very well taken care of.

The special class child has been using the same age aims for some time. Since taking over the supervision of tne physical education in all the special classes in Philadelphia the investigator has felt that there is a need for a study of the accomplishments of the mentally retarded child in track and field work. A study of Height, Weight and Jumping Ability of normal, disciplinary and backward children made in 1922 convinced the investigator that the standards for normal children were too high for the mentally retarded boy. Observation of the work since that time has only strengthened this conviction. Age aims for special class children are rare (the investigator found none at all). It seems that physical educators have been interested only in games and recreation for mentally retarded children; track and field work has not even been mentioned. There is no need here of going into the detailed discussion as to the value of track and field work.

It is sufficient to say that the events are those of fundamental activity and the child enters into them of his own accord and with great enjoyment.

Being a rather new field of study the investigation was limited to one of average performances in the events mentioned, with an added study of height and weight for purposes of classification, and a comparison with the performances made by normal children. The compilations will be made on a basis of age, of height, and of weight, and results should be of much interest to teachers of special classes besides being valuable to all educators interested in tnis type child. The comparison with the normal children's performances is used to make tne results mean more. The original intention was to make a study of correlation but it was not found feasible at the time.

In the field of psychology and of physical education there are quite a few studies of motor efficiency, athletic efficiency, etc., but there have been only a few that have used athletic events. Most of the investigations have used tapping, strength of grip, anthropometric measurements, or l’ke factors. But to really measure efficiency of this type, a broader conception—taking in strength, coordination, endurance, vitality, etc.,—is needed. Although this study is not one of correlating the physical and mental achievement the subject is brought up to show the lack of specific bibliography on the subject. The only study that really used athletic events was one made by Lanais.* The error he made was to take all students irrespective of any factor except standing in college (freshmen). A number of studies are listed by Baldwin** but nearly every one is a study of anthropometric measurements. Insofar as the special class child, as connected with track and field work is considered, a perusal of Mind and Body, The American Physical Education Review,*** the Journal of psychology, and the proceedings of the N. E. A.,—not to mention isolated articles in other periodicals and use of indexes of magazine articles,— has failed to bring to light a single article that could be used to bear upon the first part of the study. (See list of investigations below).

Method of Collecting And Handling Data

In this study the records of 1524 mentally retarded boys and 638 mentally retarded girls were gathered. The actual records of height, weight, standing broad jump, ball throw overhead, 50 yard dash, chinning (for boys) and knee raising(for girls) were taken regularly during the school year, and were recorded monthly on the regular printed forms.

These records were taken in 7 special class concentration centres, numbering 50 classes in all, with 8 teachers of physical education. The conditions under which the records were taken were of the best. Each school has a fairly well equipped playroom or gymnasium (one school has two); The teachers in all but two cases teach only physical education, the other two devote about an hour a day to some academic subject. The teachers are well prepared for their special type of work and are all vitally interested in it. Each child receives a daily 30 or 40 minute period in the gymnasium besides ah opportunity for additional after school work. A lesson in the gymnasium allows almost daily opportunity for engaging in some type of track and field work, ano this activity seems to be the most interesting in the child’s school life. As one teacher expressed it, “The children hate to leave when the bell rings.’’ Obviously for this type child the methods used must be adapted to almost individual needs the teacher must continually put forward a different type of personality and method.

Each gymnasium is provided with a standard set of scales with an attached rod for measuring height. In height and weight measurements all records were made in regular school clothing, removing coats and sweaters. Records were made in whole inches and pounds. In the standing broad jump a take-off board about three inches above the floor level was used, allowing a toe-over. Only a few .of the children wore “sneakers,” and the landing was on regular gymnasium or long corrugated rubber mats. The distance of the jump was recorded in feet and inches, and, as in all the track ana field events, only legal performances were recorded. In the ball throw overhead the actual throw in whole feet was recorded; the ball used was the regular outseam soccerball, as furnished to all schools by the Board of Education. In the 50 yard dash the running was all done in the street or pavement(no other place was available). Most of the boys and a few girls used the crouch start. In this event, to prevent slipping at the start, assistance was given the runner by bracing his foot against another boy’s foot. None but stop-watch records were entered. Teachers at times, for practice, allow the children to run against one another in single dashes or relays, but this was not for measurement. In the chinning and knee raising the adjustable horizontal bar was used. This can be adjusted to any child’s "jump” height. Though the undergrip was taught by the teachers a few of the boys preferred the over-grip. All the teachers insisted upon a full straightening of the arm following an actual “chin” before giving the boy credit for his performance. In many places, too often when a boy is about reaching his limit of endurance he is given the “benefit of the doubt” and allowed another time on his record for an incomplete chinning. But these teachers counted pnly legal chins or pull-ups. In the knee raising event the girl hangs from the horizontal bar, raises her knees until the thighs are parallel to the floor and lowers the knees to a full extension. Here again cere must be taken that the knees are raised sufficient-
300

ly high and that the legs are fully extended. This movement is repeated and a time is credited to the girl for every correct raising.

At the end of the term the record sheets were collected and each child's measurements were recorded upon a separate 3x5 card. To facilitate handling and sorting the girls cards were made out in red and the boy’s cards in blue crayon pencil.

The second study being one of comparison with the performances of normal children it was necessary to secure data under the same conditions, if possible, in a school of normal children. A school was selected where the conditions paralleled those in the concentration centers. The following factors entered into the selection—

a.	playroom or gymnasium;

b.	sufficient time allottment to mean something;

c.	teachers of approximately the same ability;

d.	satisfactory equipment;

e.	sufficient yard space.

a.	As each special concentration center was equipped with a playroom and the school selected was also equipped the same way, that factor can be eliminated.

b.	In all the schools the time allotment for physical education was a daily period of from 30 to 40 minutes.

c.	The teachers in both types of schools were especially trained in a special teachers’ course in physical education (at Temple University); their abilities obviously cannot be here dwelt upon but exactly one-half of them passed the last Junior High School examination in physical education. (This may not be germane to the investigation but it adds light to the abilities of the teachers in question).

d.	The equipment in the concentration centers was more varied and better than that in the other school.

e.	The yard space in four of the seven concentration centers is rather limited. This is about the only point in favor of the school for normal children. This is somewhat lessened by

f.	Size of class. As mentioned before, the special class child needs more specific and personal teaching; therefore the classes are composed of from 20 to24 children as compared with a normal class of from 45 to 55.

Detailed Description Of Studies

The first study made was the Age study. The cards were sorted and grouped by ages (8 years to 16 years). The distribution of Height according to each age was made by placing in table form the number of cases under each inch of height for each age (See table on Page 303). The average height for each age was obtained by multiplying each height in inches by the number of cases at that height, adding all the products and dividing by the total number of cases. The same was then done with Weight; with Standing Broad Jump; with Ball throw Over head; with 50 Yard Dash; with Chinning. Then the girls Age Study was made in the same way.

After securing the average performance the next step was to secure the “70 per cent Passing Mark.” This mark is the point on the table of distribution which, if set as an aim, 70 per cent of the pupils measured would have passed. This latter method is used by the Division of Physical Education in setting aims or standards for the Philadelphia Public Schools in track and field events.

The results in the Age Study were tabulated as follows:--Height—by inches; Weight—by pounds; Jump—by feet and inches; Throw—by whole feet; Dash—by second and tenths; Chinning—by times; Knee Raising—by times.

The Height Study followed. The cards were resorted and grouped according to heights (45 to 47; 48 to 50 inches, etc.) (See Height chart, table 6, page 304). Average performances and 70% passing performances in each event (weight, jump, throw dash, chinning, and knee raising) were then secured, using the height groupings as the basis and making use of the same method of tabulation as explained on page 300.

The Weight Study was next made. Cards were resorted and grouped according to weight groups (50 to 59; 60 to 69 pounds, etc.) (See Weight study, Table 7, page 304): Using the same method of distribution and recording as previously explained, average performances and 70 per cent passing marks were obtained in height, jump, throw, dash, chinning, and knee raising, using weight groupings as the basis.

An age-height-weight study was next begun. The cards of the 13-and the 14-year-old boys were arranged according to three divisions in height and each division in height was further sorted into three weight divisions, making nine divisions in each age. This made the groupings in four of the 18 divisions so small in size or number of cases that the findings would not have been accepted by the most extreme optimist. However, it has paved the way for a separate investigation at the end of the next school year, when a few hundred additional cases in these ages will be secured.

The Age Study of Mentally Normal children was the next in order. This is the second part of the investigation, forming a basis of comparison. The same method as previously outlined was followed, results in each event were tabulated, and a series of charts showing comparisons in each factor with mentally retarded boys and girls were made (See charts 1 to 7, pages 301-2).

Interpretation Of Results Reached.

There are two sets of tables, the one set based upon average performance and the other based upon 70 per cent passing marks. The first set only will be taken into consideration, as a discussion of the two will really be duplication, in a certain sense.

In the Age Study (Table 1) the development from the 8 year old to the 16 year old is very evident. The girls at 8 are taller than the boys at the same age, but the boys catch up only to lose out again at the age of 11, when the girls begin their period of accelerated growth. At the age of 15 the^boys are again up to

the girls. This table parallels those set up by Baldwin (1), altho the boys and girls both are below the average in more than half the cases. In jumping ability there is a steady progression from the 8 year old to the 16 year old boy with a pause at the age of 11. This condition has occurred in other investigations of the same type made for setting standards in other events. It happens in different ages and thus seems due to mechanical causes (small number of cases, making whole numbers from fractions, etc.). The yearly increases range from one inch (from 8 years to 9 years, and from 15 to 16 years) to as high as five inches (from 12 to 13 years), but w'thout any regularity. At no age are the girls able to jump as far as the boys. This is the case in nearly every study of this type made by the Division of Physical Education during the past ten years. The increases vary from one to four inches— the greater increases being found in the older girls. There is no increase from 15 to 16 year old girls, but this can easily be expected with the small number of cases. In the ball throw there is a gradual increase from the 8 year to the 16 year girl, but again a pause, this time at 16. The girls at 11 have a better average than the boys at the same age. (This is the only place this result appears in the investigation). The girls stay on the same level through the ages of 13 and 14 and then fall behind at 14 and remain there. In the dash the variation is from 2 to 4 tenths of a second with the exception again of the 11 year group. The girls are far behind the boys m running. They are six-tenths of a second behind the boys at the 8 year level; one full second behind at the 15 year level and at 16 while the boy advances four-tenths the girl goes back the same degree. In chinning or pull-up there is a gradual increase from 8 to 16. A difference of one time is* a large difference as witness the following aims in chinning for public school children in Philadelphia.-

11	years—1 time.

12	years—2 times

13	years—3 times

14	years—4 times

15	years—4 times

The averages for knee raising are altogether different from those in any other event. The girls of the ages of 8, 9, and 10 show the same average; 11 and 12 show higher results; 13 falls back; 14 comes up to the level of 11 and 12; 15 falls back, and, strange to say, 16 shows the highest average of all.

The Height Study for boys (Table 5, page 304) shows a regular increase in jumping ability, throwing ability, and running ability with increase in height. There is one place in the dasn (48 to 50 inch group) which breaks the regularity of this increase. The same study for girls shows a corresponding increase for girls in the jump up to 57-59 inch group, then the same average in the next two groups, and a falling off of three inches in the 66-68 and one more j»cb	in the 69-71 inch	group. In the throw there is^an

307

increase to 60-62 inch group, and a falling off from there on. The dash and knee raising show no regular increase or decrease for succeeding heights—height seems a poor basis for measuring these events for girls.

The Weight Study shows a corresponding increase in height excepting in the 90-99 pound class, which falls two inches below the 80-89 pound group and the 100-109 pound group. The jump shows a corresponding increase varying from one to seven inches. There is no increase from 110-119 to 120-129 pound group, but there is a decided advance from the 50-59 to 60-69 pound group. The throw shows a corresponding increase except in the 90-99 pound group, which is one foot below the preceding group, and in 130- 139, which also falls below the 120-129 pound group. There is a gradual reduction in time required to run the 50 yards, with the exception of the 110-119 group, which falls one second behind the preceding group. In chinning the 60-69 group stands out above its neighbors and breaks up a regular increase corresponding to increase in weight.

The Weight Study for girls shows a corresponding though slow increase in height in succeeding weight groups. A steady progress in jumping ability stops at the 110-119 pound group, and the next three groups have lower averages. In the throw the same development is found but the last three groups have the same average. The dash and knee raising show the same type of result as was seen in the height study—there is no regular increase or decrease to be found, only an individual average for each group. This seems to be a poor basis for standards in the four events.

The Age Study for normal children is used as a basis for comparison with the averages of the mentally backward or retarded children. It was at first hoped to make this a study of correlation, but a study of the kind that this is should precede a correlation study. The latter study is now being planned and will be carried out soon. The comparison may be used as a rough correlation of physical and mental ability when we consider the facts of the case. One set of children is normal mentally, the other set has been selected by a series of mental tests as being mentally retarded. So far as was humanly possible all factors of comparison (opportunity, time allotment, etc.) were eliminated, and the one difference or point of dissimilarity between the two sets of children is the level of mentality. The results of the comparison can then very well be taken as an indication or trend, to be followed by an actual study of correlation.

A study of either of the two tables (tables 1 and 3, page 303) or the charts on 'pages 301 and 302 will show many interesting and valuable facts. In every case the normal boys are from two to four inches taller than the mentally retarded boys (about one or two years differences on the scale). The normal boys are found to be from 9 to 20 pounds heavier (about one or two years on the scale). This bears out the investigations made in this field by numerous students interested in height-weight and other

factors as indices of health. Baldwin* gives a resume of more than two score of investigations covering a period of nearly fifty years, and the large majority of these investigations show conclusively that normal children are taller and heavier than mentally retarded children of the same age. Porter** says "precocious children are heavier and dull children are lighter than the mean children of the same age.” Sargent*** found a negative condition existing when he measured the physiques of the scholars, athletes and the honor and average man at Harvard. He found the football players the heaviest and the “scholars” the lightest of the four groups measured.

In jumping ability the 8 year-old normal boy averages 7 inches more and at 15 years the normal boy averages 13 inches more than the mentally retarded boy; the normal boy increases 25 inches in jumping ability from 8 to 15 years, the retarded boy only 19 inches; the retarded boy of 12 and the normal boy of 8 jump about the same on the average; the retarded boy of 13 is on the same level with the normal boy of 10, thus showing about three years retardation. The poorest jump made by a normal boy was that of 45 inches (3 ft., 5 in.), the best jump was one of 102 inches (8 ft., 6 in.). The mentally retarded boys varied from 24 inches to 94 inches.

In the throw the retardation is not quite so great, being about two years. The increase in throw is from 14 to 31 feet for mentally retarded boys and from 19 to 37 feet for mentally normal boys. The variation for retarded boys was from 9 to 45 feet; for normal boys from 14 to 54 feet. In the dash there is a regular improvement from 8 to 15 year group, and the comparison shows the 8 year normal group runs as fast as the 12 year retarded group; and the 11 year normal boy is just a trifle faster than the 15 year old retarded group. This shows a retardation of four years; this is more than in the jump or throw. This bears out the well-known fact of the absence of determination or, as it is often called, “stick-to-it-iveness” in retarded children. To jump requires a second or two; to throw, the same; but as soon as a mentally retarded class sees the dash, the distance seems tremendous to them, and all kinds of excuses are manufactured to excuse them in their running. Quite a few start well but the finish is very poor. It would be interesting to try a dash of 20 or 30 yards and compare the results with performances of normal children at the same distance.

There are no chinning records for normal boys at the age of 8 as this event is not used in grades under the fifth. The 9 and 10 year old boys of the retarded group have better averages than the normal, but about ninety percent of these records were

gotten especially for the comparison. When we look at the ages that fall within the grades where the event is a standard one we see immediately that there is about two years retardation.

The comparison of normal and retarded girls follows along the same lines. The difference in height is slightly in favor of the normal girls (about one-half year on the chart). The comparison in weight shows fluctuation, sometimes in favor of normal and sometimes in favor of retarded girls.

In jumping ab’lity the normal girls are far beyond tne retarded girls. The normal girl of 9 jumps one inch farther than the retarded girl of 13; the 12 year normal girl jumps as far as the retarded girl of 15; and the variation for normal was from 36 inches (3 ft.) to 87 inches (7 ft., 3 in.) whereas the variation for retarded girls was from 24 inches (2 ft.) to 80 inches (6 ft., 8 in.). The retardation is from 3 to 4 years.

In the throw the retardation is not quite so great. The 9 year normal girl is almost as high in average as the 11 year retarded girl; the 12 yea>- normal girl is on the level with the 14, 15, and 16 year retarded girls. The poorest throw by a normal girl was 12 feet, the best was 41; the poorest throw by a retarded girl was 9 feet, the best was 40. The retardation is thus shown to be about two years.

The next two events (dash and knee raising) show a retardation that is almost unbelievable. The 15 year old retarded girls have poorer averages in these two events than the normal 8 year group, showing a retardation of about 7 years. It should be here again stated that the normal girls have more and better opportunity for running because of more adequate yard space, but even this factor could not be responsible for such a great difference. It is a question of lack of coordination, strength and determination.

Application Of Results To Concrete School Work

Two sets of standards are given to physical training teachers and administrators—one set based upon actual averages, the other set based upon 70 per cent passing marks. Until four years ago the Division of Physical Education used the averages as the Age Aims or standard performances. Now the aims are based upon the 70 per cent passing mark, which method seems to be more appropriate to the regular method of marking for all subjects and also seems to be better than the average, which is closer to an 80 per cent passing mark, a mark too high for a standard. In setting up standards an ideal should be set up towards which the

Eupil should strive. A low standard has no value as an incentive, igh standard that is too difficult to reach causes a loss of interest. An aim or standard that takes care of at least 70 per cent of the school populace seems satisfactory and fair. It must also be taken into consideration that continued practice and opportunity of participation will increase this per cent. The averages of the normal pupils are slightly above the standards set down for the public schools in Philadelphia. For those who prefer height standards

310

rather than age standards, Tables 5 and 6 will prove helpful; those wishing to use weight standards will find tabulations in Tables 7 and 8.

The use of age aims in the Philadelphia Public Schools is satisfactory from two main standpoints :-

1.	Using age as a basis may make it difficult for the short or light boy, but it reaches the very great majority of the school children in a fair way;

2.	From the standpoint of adminstration it is better than any more complicated system of combination of age-he5ght-weight because it makes it very easy to administer and very simple in the matter of records.

Conclusions

So far as the data in this investigation shows we may conclude the folio wing:-

1.	Age is the best basis upon which to establish aims in track and field events. In a table of standards there should be a progression or development from one group to the next higher one, and the age study shows this better than either the height or weight study. Age is a more constant factor than height or weight, which must also be taken into consideration.

2.	Mentally backward boys are shorter and lighter than normal boys; mentally retarded girls are shorter in all ages, and lighter in ages 9 to 12 and about the same weight in ages 13 to 15.

3.	Mentally backward boys jump farther, throw farther, and run faster than mentally retarded girls (except the 11 year old group in the throw.)

4.	In all four track and field events the mentally retarded boy is from 1 1-2 to 3 years lower in average performance than the normal boy; the mentally retarded girl is from 2 to 7 years lower in average performance than the normal girl.

5.	Ability in track and field events should be taken into consideration as one index of the physical age of the child. Baldwin* * says “we cannot afford to promote the children on their I. Q.’s alone as is being advocated in this country in a broad fashion. We must also take into consideration the physical age and the social age of the child. One index of the physical age and the social age is the height and weight of the child.”

May one not add the track and field ability to this height-weight index?

Dr. Decroly** says “before assigning children to classes (special classes) they will be subjected to a very careful examination, which

will take into account the information obtained by looking up antecedents and school and family reactions, the environment in which the child was reared, physical examination and the application of tests enabling the authorities to secure data on the sensory, intellectual, emotional and motor state/'

Track and field work gives excellent data on motor state.

6.	Track and field standards should be set within reach of the mentally retarded child. It gives educators one additional method of bringing out that which may be within the child— in other words, it gives the child another avenue for development, even though he can not go^far along the way.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND THE HOME

Mrs. Drury W. Cooper, Montclair, N. J.

Realizing that you have all been trained for Physical Education and I have not, I have dared to come before you on the side of life into which we all entered untrained, “Parenthood”.

I earnestly trust that one and all of you carry your physical training into your homes for it is a needed training for all of us in the family. We have become a nation of “button pushers and lever pullers” and are headed for deterioration unless more emphasis can be put into the home on the necessity of keeping the muscles fit and fresh.

The men are neglectful enough but they are way ahead of the women in realizing this, and we, in our organization, are trying to induce the mother to have a physical examination on her birthday, believing that any woman, when she knows her physical standing will be willing to undertake to improve it; for all will find some defects.

What does physical education mean to the home? Happiness. When muscles are elastic, digestion responds favorably, nervous systems react well, tempers are sunny, smiles reign, worries seem small.

We know that physical training is needed in the rural districts just as greatly as in the urban. The fresh air is there and plenty to do outside for the boy or girl, but faulty habits are frequent, often, we also find, the work is too heavy for the growing child, and just as much ignorance of the laws of nature and hygiene as in the city.

Organized games are splendid for increasing circulation, developing muscles and in teaching fair play. Organized play is gaining fairly well in the community and is commendable, but we believe that more play activities should be fostered in the home. Let the group activity center around the home and much distress of heart and mind for parents will cease. This suggestion is not intended only for the favored few but for all parents, whatever may be their condition.

The National Congress of Parents and Teachers and our New Jersey branch have been endeavoring to stress Physical Education and Recreation. Dr. Frederick W. Maroney has been our able chairman. We have Associations in rural districts where little other mail is sent than our state and national literature. We hope we are carrying the Physical Education message as well as the inspiration to carry forward in other work.

We know we have done much to make the mothers realize that the girls need Physical Education as well as the boys, and to

bring about a change in the point of view with regard to the games played at school as being a "waste of time”.

Girls have never had the same opportunity as boys for group play and so have not learned to play “for the team” in the same way; give them the same chance and they will equal their brothers in the group spirit.

"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control, these three alone lead to sovereign power.”—Tennyson.

Dr. C. F. Weege tells us that “Investigations in psychology and pedagogy have proved beyond doubt that all that man is mentally, he has become through physical activities. The motor experiences that the race has had for centuries have left indelible impressions on the field of sub-consciousness, and, according to his customary action, man is rated; he will be called either courageous or timid, firm or fickle, discreet or reckless, persevering or inconsistent.”

Physical Training has a right to greater recognition as a factor in Mental Education. We are past the time of suggesting that we might have something good to offer, that Physical Education might add something toward building up the race. All thinking people now realize that unless one is in prime condition physically, all else can wait.

Reflection and determination, perseverance and self-control are tools of mentality, and necessary in making the best use of knowledge; the curriculum of Physical Education must be evaluated according to its capacity for keeping these tools in good condition.

Physical training should seek, not only to produce health, but to form good habits. ^If all Physical Training workers, when they have opportunity to speak to the familiv of the student, would suggest that a playground be provided on the home lot and that organized games be stressed, they will find it will do wonders for the rural child and the homes will also begin to profit by the training. \

AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SERVICE TO ALL SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES JUNIOR, SENIOR, AND FOUR YEAR HIGH SCHOOLS, BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC.

The American CHILD HEALTH association invites you make a study of your school health program during the second half of the present school year and to submit it for comparison with the health programs of other Secondary Schools. The reason for such an undertaking is the very widespread interest in health education work in High Schools as evidenced by frequent requests for information from High School teachers and principals.

The studies will be judged by a committee selected from prominent educators and professional workers in the health field. We propose, through a published report, to make available the effective programs as selected by this committee, due credit being given for each contribution used.

The general points determing the judgments may be roughly indicated Dy the following statement of the factors considered important in a health program, such as permanency, scope, workability, and community and civic significance.

In other words,

The value of a health program involves consideration of some of the following points:

1.	Its relation to the rest of the school program.

2.	The degree which it is temporary or permanent in the general program of the school.

3.	The percentage of teachers and pupils in the school included in or affected by it.

4.	The practical results which may be measured objectively as compared with theoretical aims and required knowledge.

5.	The degree to which the program in the school extends into the homes and communities.

6.	The relationship between the amount of money expended, facilities provided and results obtained. The spirit, purpose and results of the program are of greater significance than the quantity of expenditure.

7.	The extent to which this program in the schools would affect the later lives of the pupils as indicated by the program submitted.

One thousand dollars will be evenly divided among the three schools contributing the three leading programs. This sum of money is offered for the furtherance of education and is to be used by the schools to promote health projects. Each of the three leading schools will receive $333.

If you are interested and would like to receive the details and definite outline of precedure, write at once to the Secretary of the Project, American CHILD HEALTH Association, 370 Seventh Avenue, New York City.

This first indication of interest implies no responsibility on your part. If after receiving our detailed outline you wish to enroll formally, your application must reach us by January 10th, 1925.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OUTDOOR RECREATION.

The National Conference on Outdoor Recreation called by the President, held in Washington May 22, 23 and 24, resulted in a permanent organization of which Chauncey J. Hamlin of Buffalo, N. Y., was elected chairman, according to an announcement made by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt who acted as executive chairman of the recent meeting.

John C. Merriam, head of the Carnegie Institution, was sleeted vice-chairman, George Scott of Chicago treasurer, and Vernon Kellogg, formerly of Leland Stanford University, secretary.

The President’s original committee, consisting of Secretary Weeks, Secretary Hoover, Secretary Work, Secretary Davis, Secretary Wallace, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt,

was continued in the permanent organization as advisors to the newly formed conference.

128 organizations sent 309 delegates to Washington to the Conference. For the first time in our history representatives of every interest in outdoor recreation joined together to consider the formation of a national recreation policy which would conserve and extend our national recreation resources. The conference exceeded all expectations in attendance, in subject matter considered, in practical accomplishments and in harmonious agreement on the fundmental principles involved.

Following three days intensive work of nineteen special committees comprehensive reports were presented containing valuable data on the present situation with reference to outdoor recreation together with constructive suggestions for meeting needs. These reports will be published later.

The conference then adopted a set of resolutions which may well become the basis for a national recreation policy. It emphasized the fundamental value of the proper use of outdoor leisure time activities as a means of developing organic vigor, as an educational agent, as a wholesome stabilizer in the development of an able and worthy citizenship. It called attention to the urgent necessity for developing a general recognition of these basic values as opposed to the limited and superficial view commonly held regarding play and recreation. It emphasized the need of well formulated principles and of qualified leaders for the conduct of leisure time activities, which are potent in the development of either good or bad character, so that the foregoing desirable objectives shall be obtained, instead of harmful results. The conference urged that the needs of the country’s fifteen million rural children be studied and provided for as a means of enriching country life and counteracting the lure of the city. It stated that the basic recreation needs of all children are the same, and that a statement of average outdoor standards for children should be made after careful study.

The conference further urged that the 400 cities and towns of 8000 or more reported to be without a single playground or play leader take up the study of the outdoor recreation needs of children with the purpose of immediate action.

It further urged that outdoor recreation facilities be put within the reach of industrial workers, and to this end suggested that industries and mercantile establishments not only provide for their own employees but also support municipal provision of wholesome outdoor recreation facilities.

Declaring that our National Park System is our greatest heritage of an animate and inanimate nature and that our National Forests are areas that should be set aside and maintained for both productive and recreational uses, the conference called upon the Federal Government to make a careful survey of all available resources of parks, forests and public lands to determine the recreational facilities of such areas; and to create a permanent

Digitized by

Google
316

body to investigate the problems of Federal land policy so far as they relate to recreation.

Other resolutions called for the protection of wild flowers and plants by legislation and popular education; for a better administration of our wild life, including game, fur-bearing animals and birds, through propagation, refuges, prevention of destructive practices; that a scientific investigation be made of all fishery resources; that public opinion be educated as to the danger of destructive pollution of our rivers and coastal waters; that it is the duty of every community to provide and operate either by public or private means adequate space for play and recreation, and that at least 10 per cent of the area of a community properly distributed should be regarded as the minimum for this purpose.

The emphasis of the whole conference was upon the utilization of our vast resources for the building of a happy citizenship through bringing joy and gladness to the men, women and children of America.

An advisory council of not to exceed 100 men and women is to carry on the work started at the conference. From this number eleven were chosen as an Executive Committee. These eleven are:

Chauncey J. Hamlin, American Association of Museums.

John C. Merriam, American Association for Advancement of Sciences.

Vernon Kellogg, National Parks Association.

George Scott, Izaak Walton League.

Walter F. Martin, National Catholic Welfare Council Mrs. Jane Deeter Rippin, Girl Scouts of America.

Mrs. John D. Sherman, General Federation of Womens Clubs John Barton Payne, American Red Cross.

Charles Sheldon, Boone and Crockett Club

George Shiras, 3rd, National League of Wild Life Photographers James E. West, Boy Scouts of America.

The Executive Committee, after carefully reviewing and canvassing the field of outdoor recreation, and the various existing national organizations which have been devoting their efforts to various phases of the subject, announced the following declaration of policy:

The Advisory Council of the National Conference on Outdoor Recreation believes that it is not its function to take over the exploitation of any part of the field of outdoor recreation, but rather to support, endorse and seek assistance from the various national organizations already at work in this field.

Pursuant to this policy announcement is made that by resolutions duly adopted the following national organizations have been requested to undertake certain fact-finding surveys which appear to the Committee as fundamental to any carefully formulated National Plan for Outdoor Recreation:

The Playground and Recreation Association of America, has been requested, to undertake a survey of county and municipal parks, forests, nlavaxounds, water, and other reservations.

Digitized by kjOOQle
317

The National Conference on State Parks has been requested to undertake a survey of state parks, waters, forests and other reservations.

The American Forestry Association and the National Park Association have been requested to appoint a joint committee to undertake a joint survey through their organizations of the Federal parks, forests, reservations and other public lands and waters.

The American Association of Museums has been requested to undertake a survey of the contributions that can be made by the natural history museums of the country in the fields of outdoor recreation and conservation through teaching an understanding love of nature.

It is the intention of the Advisory Council to request other national organizations to make similar surveys in the field of the social significance of outdoor recreation in its relation to child life, health, industrial workers, rural recreation needs, athletic games, sports, etc. Also in the field of the value of natural resources to outdoor recreation with particular reference to forests, game and fur-bearing animals, fish, birds, plants and flowers, waters, etc.

It is believed that through the close co-operation of such pii-vate agencies and government agencies, federal, state, county and municipal, it will be possible eventually to evolve a National Plan for Outdoor Recreation in whicn each agency, public and private, will have and play its part to the end that our country will be a happier, healthier place in which to live and that opportunity may be open to all to gain abounding health, strength, wholesome enjoyment, understanding and love of nature, good fellowship and keen sportsmanship. Such opportunities will tend to the fonnation of that sturdy character by developing those qualities of self-control, endurance under hardship, reliance on self, and co-operation with others in team work, which is so necessary to good citizenship.

Announcement was also made that the following officers were selected by the Executive Committee:

Chauncey J. Hamlin, Chairman;

Dr. John C. Merriam, Vice Chairman;

Dr. Geo. E. Scott, Treas. and Ch’m. Finance Committee;

Dr. Vernon Kellogg, Secretary.

All communications should be addressed to the National Conference on Outdoor Recreation, and sent to the temporary headquarters of the Committee, Room 2034 New Navy Building, Washington, D. C.

SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPLES DEVELOPED AND THE POINTS EMPHASIZED AT THE 1924 HEALTH EDUCATION CONFERENCE, HELD AT CAMBRIDGE, MASS.

TEACHERS TRAINING SECTION

Personal Health of Student

I.	Adequate development in health for the student teacher is imperative because of its effect upon her happiness and teaching •efficiency, because of the necessity of a high standards of personal health if she is to develop proper health standards among her pupils and meet her opportunities for leadership in the community.

II.	A successful health program in the teacher.training centers demands cooperation of each department in the institution or training cou'se. Student health cannot be developed through the activity of a single department. Unless sound health ideals, attitudes and practices are to be found throughout the whole faculty group and in the practice school it cannot be expected that the student teache-s will adequately develop them. We must consider the student as a unit and as a human being, affected by her enviomment.

Departments giving courses of instruction which bear upon the subject matter of health or the methods of teaching health, must so coordinate then* work as to provide the student with a well rounded informational basis and the educational technic for making her knowledge effective in her school room.

III.	A complete health examination by a competent physician upon the entrance of every student should be the basis for the student’s subsequent program. Such an examination, however, without adequate follow up resulting in actual health maintenance and improvement is futile.

The correction of a poor physical condition by the establishing of right habits of living is quite as important as a correction demanding medical or surgical treatment.

The institution or training course is responsible for making available the necessary facilities and conditions for the health improvement required. If additional funds are required to secure corrections the institution should assist the students to secure them.

Some institutions are already recognizing the responsibility of the student to develop the best possible standard of health for that individual. The time is doubtless at hand when a reasonable health standard, with proper consideration of the limitations of the individual, will be demanded as a requisite for graduation.

IV.	It is understood that the responsibility for the control of living conditions of the students includes the prevision of proper housing with suitable facilities for social life; well-balanced dietary under the supervsion of a well trained dietitian; adequate ana suitable physical activities; necessary medical and nursing service and a supervision over the student’s daily program. Very commonly the freshmen student in teacher training institutions has been found to bo carrying a program, either within the institution or in

Digitized by

Google
319

extra curricular activities,- which has been heavier than a proper consideration of the student’s physical condition would permit.

V.	A study of the problem of administering the health program in a teacher training institution or in teacher training courses demonstrates that the basic responsibility rests upon the administrative head of such an institution or program. He best can organize the requisite machinery and secure the necessary cooperation and coordination among different departments with promptness and effectiveness. It has been demonstrated that the success of this program depends upon the administrator’s appreciation of the problems involved.

Courses of Study

There is distinct need for developing a technic of measuring health which may be used in determining the success of the Student Health Program in maintain’ng and improving health.

The problem of the program of instruction differs according to the type of institution. The following classes of teachers training centers are described by the American Association of Teachers’ College.

A-Institution granting a Bachelor’s Degree and providing graduate work.

B-Institution with a four year course and granting a Bachelor’s Degree.

C-Institution with a three or four year course, granting a certificate but not a degree.

D-Institution with a two year course of study and granting a certificate.

In addition, there are Normal classes which may be grouped as the underprivileged training courses. As these courses furnish the only training for a large proportion of our rural and small town teachers, it is important to develop the type of education training which will meet their peculiar needs. In these underprivileged classes the one year course must provide opportunity for the development of student health and also subject matter and methods of health training.

In institutions of the first three types a first year course in Hygiene should be a part of the complete Student HealthlProgram above described. The prime object of this course should be the improvement of the health of the student.

In the remaining three years, special training should be provided in methods of teaching health. Supplementary subject-matter courses in allied subjects will be provided according to the facilities of the institution.

It is essential that work in the field of psychology should include a consideration of the factors involved in maintaining the mental health of normal children and the study of maladjustments.

It is desirable to give academic credit the required course in hygiene.

Examples of the courses offered, in the various kinds of institutions, are to be found in the conference discussions of the section meetings.

ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION

Personal Health of the Teacher.

I.	Every teacher applying for a position should have an examination by a competent and impartial physician accredited by the Board of Education which will enable her to understand her physical limitations, and provision should be made for her to correct these deficiencies.

Only healthy applicants should be given permanent positions, it being understood that permanent teachers’ licenses will not be granted until steps have been taken toward reaching the highest physical efficiency. A thorough examination should be made, using form prepared by the National Health Council.

II.	The school environment, routine and supervision should be such as will make it possible for the teachers to remain healthy.

III.	Sick leave on pay is recommended. The teacher’s health record should be considered as one factor in her professional equipment.

IV.	Teachers' retirement or pension funds administered according to the best practices, are recommend eo in order to eliminate fear of dependence which, at present, prevents teachers from occasionally taking the all-important year off, for physical and professional rejuvenation. For the sake of physical and professional rejuvenation teachers should be allowed to take an occasional year off with at least half pay.

In addition to the physical examination it is advised that one good text on health of such type as Fisher & Fisk’s “How To Live” or Williams’ “Personal Hygiene Applied”, be recommended to the teacher. A social consciousness should be aroused in Parent-Teacher Associations and other organizations as to the importance of maintaining the health of a teacher at a high standard.

Public opinion should be developed so as to make effective or possible the foregoing provisions.

It is the sense of the conference that because there are no figures available concerning the health of the teachers in this country a study should be made at the earliest possible date for the purpose of ascertaining present conditions. This should serve as a basis for further steps in sustaining a high state of teachers’ health efficiency. Along with this investigation should go a study of all measures being taken to safeguard and promote the health of teachers.

Guiding Principles for the Gradation of Subject Matter and Development of Teaching Methods.

I.	The following were accepted as principles underlying the choice of subject matter for all grades. Though each aspect will appear in every grade it was agreed that

(a)	The chief emphasis should be on personal health in kindergarten to grade six.

(b)	The chief emphasis should be on community health

and socially healthful behavior in grades seven, eight and mne.

(c)	The chief emphasis should be on giving a scientific

background, in grades nine to twelve.

II.	The following principles underlying method were accepted as forming desirable motivation for health instruction in all grades, namely, that:

(a)	Health Education activities should be purposeful.

*.e., they should develop pennanent values for the children, (Self control, self direction, self improvement).

(b)	Activities should be of value to children as children.

(c)	Activities should provide for the free expression of

child nature.

III.	All grades should use:

(a)	1. Concrete life situations and capitalize these in class room work.

2.	Analogy between child's development and that of plant and animal life, using resources of nature study or general science.

3.	The rules of healthy living as the basis for the selection of subject matter in all grades. The development of the child and the growing richness of the course of study offer that constantly. Fresh approach necessary to prevent monotony.

4.	Emphasis on formation of health habits from the kindergarten through grade six.

(b)	In the Pre School period should be emphasized

1.	Nouns for the geography of the body,

2.	Verbs for its functions.

(c)	Kindergarten and grades one to three should:

1.	See that all have the same vocabulary and improve the technic of health activities associated with the terminology.

2.	Represent the routine of healthy living in today situations.

(d)	Grades four to six could well base the presentation of

health subject matter upon:

1.	Interest in the life processes of animals and plants.

2.	Interest in acquiring more conscious control of the human machine.

3.	More understanding of the significance of health habits for the individual, and for basis for development of social responsibility.

(r) Grades seven, eight and nine.

1. The approach to health teaching is based upon the developing of interest in scientific investigation manifested at this age. This interest should motivate laboratory and field studies in general science and civics;—this will direct and inform

the adolescent’s growing sense of responsibility to home, school and community.

2.	Man’s ability to control disease through knowledge of its cause should here be developed, also a knowledge of public health practices.

3.	Development of scientific background for personal health should be begun in these grades, through physiology and hygiene carefully selected and taught.

4.	Performance activities, such as home nursing and first aid, are valuable at this age.

(f) Senior High, grades nine to twelve.

The dominating factor in health instruction through these years should be provision of scientific information applied to health problems,— supplied through the coordinated efforts of such specialized departments as may exist in High Schools as: botany, zoology, biology, physiology bacteriology, chemistry and physics, as well as the social sciences and home economics.

The above program is necessary to supplement the health education work usually done by departments of physical education.

WATER PLAYS AND PAGEANTS HELP SWIMMING

GROW

By Commodore W. E. Longlellow

In its educational campaign to promote swimming and life saving for all people in the United States, the American Red Cross has been doing an interesting work in developing water programs, including interesting pageants. We feel that the proper dedication and formal opening for swimming pools with a pageant or water play wMl influence its whole service to the community.

The plays emphasize swimming for health, for safety, as a sport, and for fun in that order. Pools which are solely for the development of speed competition seldom reach a large section of the community, so swimming for health is stressed. Safety is one of the results of stressing swimming for health and complimentary to it.

The sport and fun phases of swimming need very little em-

J)hasis, ana in fact are their own best advertisement as they come ater in the program. With this four-fold program every element in the community which can be interested in swimming can be

Google
323

brought together for the opening ceremonies, and feel they have a part in this new pool which shall serve as a developer of swimmers in that community in which they all live.

When the magnificent swimming pool at the Washington University in St. Louis was completed and dedicated a few years ago, I wrote the pageant showing “Neptune” for the opening exercises, and we drew on the Missouri Athletic Club, the Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., the University students and graduates, and the pupils of various swimming pools to make the pageant a success. Miss Betty Grimes, the National Diving Champion, was brought in to show the top-notch diving, and I played the part of Neptune. Some of the musical clans of the University assisted, as did groups of aesthetic dancers, who made up the Court of Neptune. Twenty-five hundred persons saw the pageant and the pool in the first two nights.

Since then the pageant has been used in opening more than seventy-five more new swimming pools, and we have been called upon to provide other pageants and programs. The demonstration of water games and plays at the various Red Cross Life Saving Training Institutes helps to spread the technique of water pageantry among swimming teachers of the country, and many new plays are being developed, and summer camps combine the services of the musicians, dancers and swimmers.

Among these camp plays “Pipes of Pan” has been a popular one for both out-door and indoor presentation. Under this title it was written by Lucy South Proudfoot as a camp play. It was re-written under the title of the“Magic Pipes” by Esther Rutan, and produced by graduates of the Chicago Normal School of Physical Education; the musical setting was arranged by Frances M. Arnold.

Miss Olive McCormick, Director of Physical Education at the Carroll club, New York, also produced a version of this theme in her pool under the title of “Narcissa and the Hunter,” a water ballet, using both swimmers and dancers from the gym. Last winter in New York, Miss McCormick brought out a new water play called the “Conch Shell,” which brings in swimming and life saving, as well as dancing. In this all the parts, even that of Neptune, were played by girls of the Club.

The arrangement of the pool for such plays is interesting, and as one has to use a pool which has very small seating accommodations, it is necessary to erect both a balcony and stage over the pool itself. In this case the seating platform is usually over the shallow end of the pool, if the exits warrant, and the stage is built over the deep end, leaving opening for the water work between the two of about twenty-five to thirty feet. For a play given several successive nights this would close up the pool, but usually regular swimmers get all the water work they need during the time of the performance. These water plays are usually benefits for the Pool Department, or the contribution of the Swimming Department for the maintenance funds of the parent-organization with which they are affiliated.
324

Within her own organization, Miss McCormick found musicians, scenic artists and costume designers, and was able to get volunteers to do the building of the stage scenery and bleachers, although the necessary lumber had to be purchased. It was a very splendid performance.

Miss Helen Miller prepared an interesting water pageant called “The Lorelei Retold” for presentation at the Girl Scout Camp Reservation, Camp Bonnie Brae at East Otis, Massachusetts. This brought in swimming, life saving and music.

For the same camp Mrs. Cecilia Deubig presented my Neptune pageant under the title, showing Neptune's daughter, m which she played the part of Aphrodite.

Other programs for water shows will include a pageant “How Swimming Grew Up,” which includes the evolution of swimming, diving and life saving; the Water Circus; the District Swimming School; Bird and Animal Show; Night at Palm Beach; Night in Hawaii; Night in Venice; Night at Coney Island and the Water Playground Night.

The Red Cross Life Saving Service has Division Headquarters locatea in Boston, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco, and at each of these is a trained staff of Life Saving experts, who assist in the dedication and opening of swimming pools and promotion of all phases of the health and safety water program. They serve without expense to the community and their services can be secured through the local Red Cross, which is in any of the large cities throughout the country, if sufficient notice is given.

The Life Saving Service of the Red Cross is planning to get a collection of Water Plays and Pageants in pamphlet form for free distribution and swimming instruction for pools, schools and camps, so that the whole country can have the advantage of these educational and interesting presentations of swimming in its most desirable form. It is not unreasonable to prophesry that before long trained companies of swimmers and players will be presenting water dramas and comedies over the "swimming pool circuit”.

“Ten Things that Need Consideration”

1.	A state department of physical education which will have authority and supervision over the physical education of every public school, including all interscholastic physical contests.

2.	The establishment of physical education as a regular part of the school program of studies.

3.	Daily participation in physical education required of all in school, who are capable, and appropriate credit given.

4.	Definite minimal professional qualifications required of all those who have the direction of the physical education in the public schools.

5.	Intramural contests on a mass basis.

6.	Sufficient space provided, as accessible to the school building as possible, for facility of operation of a general out-door program of physical exercises and sports.

325

7.	Scientific determination of physiological classes of all individuals for exercises and contests.

8.	Scientific construction of a scale that will show the range of physical ability between these physiological classes, for use in forming equal teams in contests.

9.	Interscholastic contests on the basis of physiological class.

10.	Determination of a technique for obtaining the index of

physical efficiency of each individual by means of tests. Such an index would indicate the relation of the performance of each individual to the mean performance of all others in the same physiological group, and would serve as a guide for improvement.

PERFORMANCE OF A WARM AIR FURNACE WITH ANTHRACITE AND BITUMINOUS COAL

The tests reported by Professor Krats were supplementary to those reported in connection with the warm-air fumade heating research work at the Engineering Experiment Station of the University of Illinois. The same general arrangement of testing equipment was used, consisting in this particular case of a cast iron circular-radiator type cf warm-air furnace erected under a three-story steel structure :n the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. This structure served as the working skeleton of a house, and carried the stacks and registers for the various floors. A two-piece unslotted pot was used for all tests on anthracite coal, and a one-piece slotted pot for the tests on bituminous coal. For one of these tests the slots were sealed with fire-clay.

Two objects were sought in the tests, one, to compare the performance of the same furnace operating with anthracite and bituminous coal and, second, to determine the effect of the use of a slotted fire-pot on the operation with bituminous coal.

Performance curves for the furnace fired with two types of coal indicate that:

1—	Within practical combustion rates the anthracite coal gave higher efficiency and capacity (based on rise in the temperature of the am from the inlet to bonnet) than the bituminous coal for the same combustion rate. At combustion rates that are excessive for warm-air furnace practice, however, the reverse was true.

2—	In the case of the bituminous coal, the efficiency was more nearly constant over the whole range of combustion rates than it was for the anthracite coal.

3—	At a given combustion rate, more draft between the ash pit and smoke outlet was required to operate the furnace on anthracite coal than on bituminous coal.

4—	With bituminous coal, as fired under the conditions of the tests, the slotted fire-pot gave about 9 per cent greater efficiency and capacity than in the firepot with the slots sealed.

An interesting fact brought out in connection with the temperature of the heating surfaces was that the fire pot temperatures increase with an increase in combustion rate for anthracite coal, while the reverse is true for bituminous coal. This decrease in temperature indicates that the higher drafts required to produce the higher combustion rates cause an increase in the amount of air drawn through the slots, and result in cooling the firepot. The temperature of the firepot was uniformly lower for the bituminous coal than for the anthracite coal. The firepot temperature was also materially lower for the slotted firepot than for one with the slots sealed. Accumulations of soot in the radiator in the bituminous coal tests amounted to about 1 1-2 lbs. at low combustion rates and were neglible at high rates .—HealingMagazine.

Prof. Neuendorf writes: “I had the opportunity twice during the summer to observe mass exercises on a large scale at Gymnastic Festivals. The exercises were not executed in the usual fashion of the 4-4 time. The poises were skilfully arranged and set to music that corresponded to the peculiar movements. Such exercises, undoubtedly, are more useful in body building than those practiced in 4-4 time. Doubt, however, existed, as to whether their spectacular aspect was as impressive as the others for exhibition purposes. The effect the exercises made on both occasions was very pronounced and removed all doubt as to their spectacular value also.”

In a pamphlet published in the interest of public health, edited by Gerhard Wagner the writer speaks about tuberculosis and Physical Training. He says: “To combat tuberculosis efficiently requires not only tracing the source of the malady or the scrutiny of the social conditions of the individual, but in addition the general health must be taken into consideration. As a medium of merit he favors sport. To support his contention he quotes the sport organizations of the city of Schmalkalden. Formerly only 20 to 30 percent of the young men of Schmalkalden were enlisted in the army for military duties, but after 30 years of organized sport the percentage rose to 65 to 70. The strengthening of the entire organism by bodily exercises, the inhalation of sufficient pure air, the exposure to sunlight, combined with proper diet, are the best mediums to combat and prevent tuberculosis.”

The Physiological Section of the German University of Physical Education, composed of experienced physicians with high professional reputations, discussed at one of their meetings the finding

of the mental conditions of Marathon runners, before and after the run. Seven Marathon runners were examined. The different tests which were applied to determine their exact mental conditions brought out the fact that hardly any mental exhaustion was noticeable.

The following exceipts are from a statement, published by Carl Diem, of gymnastic events of pupils in the Berlin Stadium.

"On three different occasions I had the opportunity to observe gymnastic events. Each festival had its merits. It is, however, important to correct the erroneous idea that a high number of participants is the standard by which gymnastic meets are judged. It is rather the character of the festival that decides the standard of the meet. The real physical benefit of spectacular mass drills is trifling. Real value from physical training is only obtained by daily practice. The main number of one of the meets was a combination of calisthenics and postural positions which were executed with vigor and energy. Eveiybody in the audience admired it, because the exercises had a distinct physical value. Another number in the program, a run was a failure. Running is an important healthful exercise and requires strct attention in regard to speed, time and posture. Less important are jumping, swimming, climbing, wrestling and play. Acrobatics and stunts take third place. I would not have made any adverse remarks, but the running event compels me to point to defects, which, for the good of the cause, should be remedied.

Austria has since 1920 added to her Sporting-Swimmers and Co-worker-Swimmers another group called Turner-Swimmers. The aim of all three organizations is to make swimming popular among the masses. The Turner-Swimmers are affiliated with the German Turner Bund of Austria which has a membership of 82,000. A few years ago the Bund incorporated swimming as one of the competitive events in their meets. Soon lively swimming contests were held in Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurt and elsewhere. First the breast stroke and swimming on the back were the only officially recognized movements. Since then, the more modern strokes have been officially added. In case Turner-Swimming in Austria develops proportionately in the future as it did in the last few years, then the Turner-Swimmers will not only lead in number, but may also be the leaders in scoring the highest records among gymnastic organizations the world over.

What Is Physical Education? Every war, doubtless from the first of them, has been accompanied and followed by lamentations over the scarcity of men of the first fitness for fighting. These lamentations have, in numerous instances, ancient and modem, been followed up with efforts at improving the health and physique of the rising generation along lines which, at the time, seemed suitable to produce the desired results. The suggestions of the need for physical education made by great thinkers, such as John Locke, Pestalozzi, Rousseau and Spencer, who had the welfare of the individual child at heart, have usually fallen upon deaf ears; but when the need for cannon fodder was felt and expressed by statesmen or warriors, attention has been given and something has been done to remedy the situation, even if it was ephemeral and useless^

(Legislation for physical education in the public schools which has been successful in some thirty or more states (though it had been put in practice in but few of these) was the result of the war and not of the demand for such laws on the part of education, although the latter recognized, in a feeble way, that physical education is at the root of all education and that the effectiveness and the economical working of the machinery for mental training depend on the bodily condition of the child with which it deals^

There was such a spasm of encouragement of physical development at the time of the Civil War, military drill being considered the best means for such development, and the influence of this movement still survives. There was a similar self examination for causes of poor physique and searching for means of improvement in England, following the Boer War^ The Swedish system of gymnastics was chosen as the best nfethod for muscular exercise, but the committee of investigation had the good sense to observe that, for a very large number of the children of the realm, not exercise but feeding was most needed and that the former without the latter would do more harm than good. Probably this was the most notable pronouncement in physical education that has occurred, as it was the first official recognition that our attempt at a maximum unfolding of the physical nature of the child must be put upon the basis of adequate nutrition. Before that time everything in physical training was exercise; now it must be feeding, rest—then exercise. Our present nutritional work in schools may not have had its origin in this report of the British Committee, but it follows along the same line.

We have mentioned the Swedish System of gymnastics. This and the methods devised by Jahn and his followers in Germany and the system which arose in other European countries all had

Digitized by Google
329

a patriotic stimulus at the bottom of them and, while accepted by schools, had an eye to the furnishing of material for the army.

All these methods, ingenious as they were, failed to develop one hundred per cent perfect men, and, though formal training in physical training exercises had gone on for a hundred or so years, the number of those imperfect for military purposes was about as great as it was in countries where no such training had been in progress.

In passing laws and arranging courses in physical education in our own land in the twentieth century there has been inherited in many quarters the tradition that physical education means only exercise. It is most unfortunate, for exercise has long been tried and found wanting, in itself, to cure our bodily faults or to develop our somatic possibilities. There is considerable in a name sometimes, and in the present case it means very much to the cause of physical education that the term should be considered as including every means, prenatal and postnatal, in the home, in the school and elsewhere, that can be brought to bear to make possible the bodily unfolding of the child.

It means, above all things, ample animal nutrition, rest, and fresh air; it includes the removal of physical handicaps that can be removed, protection against infections, and a hygienic atmosphere at home, at school and in the community as a whole.

Physical educators, if they would have their wares properly evaluated in future, should.be careful not to use a general term for the part, and not to present the public with athletics, or gymnastics, or medical inspection, under the name of physical education.

Even as a whole, physical education is greatly limited as to what it can accomplish, for, through all its agencies combined it can hardly eliminate more than a fraction of the defects displayed by the draft, for a very large proportion of these are a part of our human and animal inheritance and are likely to appear (unless the eugenists can save the day) in the draft for the wars of the year 3000. Medical Journal and Record, New York, March. Note by Editor of Mind and Body.

The above is a splendid article that should help to make teachers pause who still think of physical education in terms of muscular work. But, judging by the article the editors of the “Medical Journal and Record” also have discovered only a part cf what now is understood to be the field of physical education. For example, the effect of muscular exercises as creators of “Joy in Effort,” their stimulating and hygienic mental effects are no mean phase of the aims of modern physical education. Then, the social effects of our work, the conscious and deliberate use of certain forms of physical education for moral training also appear to have been overlooked so far by a part of the medical profession. Physical education programs and procedures, therefore, should be judged by their results not only upon the physique, but also in the domain of the mind, and by their socializing, humanizing effects.

Mind, Body, and Good Health. Does good health and long life depend most on the mind or the body? In this materialistic age, since the war materialism has increased, the question would be answered at once by the majority of people that health and longevity depend chiefly upon the body. At the same time, those who think deeply are becoming convinced that there is a much closer relationship between mind and body with regard to the maintenance of good health than is generally believed. Moreover, is it not possible or even probable that disease comes because mind and body are not working in harmony as they ought to work, and that in the production of disease or in its prevention, the mind plays a more important role than the body?

The belief which has been promulgated during recent years that diseases of the mind, that is, certain forms of mental disorder, have their origin in a bodily ailment, is receiving a great deal of attention. In fact, some clinical investigators say they have proved the point. In perfect health, it may be assumed that mind and body work in complete unison, and in disease this unison is broken. Longevity may be as much a mental and spiritual question as a physical one.

As Mr. James Douglas, well known English writer, put it a short time ago, the secret of health may be found to reside, not in the arteries, the heart, the colon, the intestines, the kidneys, the spleen, the pancreas, the lymphatic or ductless glands, the nerves, nor indeed in any of the organs or nerves of the body, but in the spirit which controls all these organs and all the other energies and activities of the body. He points out that the atomic theory, which was made the subject of the presidential address of the British Association for the Advancement of Science this year by Sir Ernest Rutherford, a main originator of the atomic theory, has brought us closer to the secret of life. It has revealed to us the fact that in ourselves there is a universe of whirling energy which flows through our blood stream.

The secret of good health and long life, according to Mr. Douglas, lies in the coordination of the spirit and the body, and the harmony of both with the spirit of the universe. Mr. Douglas thinks that good health is to be brought about by means beyond our ken, and it is gained more by faith than reason. While medical men wall hardly go so far as the English writer in believing that health and disease are dependent on the spirit alone, or rather on the coordination of the spirit and the body, few will deny that faith goes a long way both in bringing about and preserving health.

The object of this article is to draw attention to the intimate relationship of mind and body and their influence on the health. If the mind and body act in harmony and the ordinary rational rules of health are followed, long life is likely to be the sequence, at least, much more frequently than if the contrary is the case. The mind is probably the arbiter of health and long life as much as is the body. Optimism and the will to live will often pull a person through a serious illness, and of course the converse is true.
381

And yet so far as long life is concerned, heredity plays a leading part. Many of those who have reached a green old age have been frail and sometimes puny individuals, whose conditions of life have not been ideal, but generally if their ancestry be probed into, it will be found that they come of a longlived stock. Perhaps, and this is a question which might be investigated with some profit, they come from forebears who were possessed of stout courage, with the will to live. Psychology is making great progress, and many moot points in this direction are likely to be cleared up soon. It is not well to be too skeptical of what we do not understand. There are many things yet of which our knowledge is elementary. It may be stated with conviction that the influence of the mind on the body is very great, and that good health and long life depend considerably on the state of mind. Med. Journaland Record N.

Respiration and Circulation in Physical Training.

Dr. Chailley-Bert, collaborator of the late Professor Langlois, called attention to the fallacy of trying to judge lung capacity by external measurements (superior and inferior chest circumference). Such measurements take no account of the work of probably the most important muscle—the- diaphragm. The chest measurements may be lamentably poor and the pulmonary ventilation good, or vice versa. In one case the diaphragm moves freely; in the other, this muscle is practically blocked. The spirometer gives fairly good results when the subject has learned to use it. While the spirometer measures vital capacity, it fails to differentiate between two other essential elements: the tidal air (the air that passes in and out in breathing) and pulmonary ventilation (the quantity of air breathed each minute.) Many athletes have an excellent vital capacity, yet get out of breath quickly. This appears, at first, incomprehensible, but closer examination will reveal that the tidal air is inadequate and, in consequence, pulmonary ventilation is poor. Such persons are shallow breathers; they have good lungs, but do not know how to use them. With proper training, they may become completely transformed.

Muscular work affects the circulatory system in two ways: by accelerating the rate to meet the needs and by increasing the volume of blood carried by each heart beat. The maximal physiologic limit of 160 beats a minute may be greatly exceeded during periods of great effort. In the trained athlete, the return to a normal rate takes place in a few minutes after moderate exercise. But the situation is quite different when a race is hotly contested, as when a cross-country run ends in a sprint. Formidable demands are then made on the whole organism. The pulse may reach 240 and the return to normal be long delayed. The organism is loaded with toxins, and an hour or even longer may be needed for their elimination. The same effects are produced by long distance races, marathons or six-day bicycle races. The pulse rate may exceed 200, and the return to rest conditions requires a long time. Here, other organs also are involved. The kidneys

Exercise and the Circulation. One of the immediate effects of muscular exercise is the acceleration of the heart beat. Even with a comparatively slight performance, the pulse rate of an adult may rise to 100 a minute; when the work done is heavier, the figure may exceed 150. Under such conditions it is evident that profound changes must be produced in the circulation, indirectly influencing all the tissues of the organism. It is commonly believed that the capabilties of the circulation form the foremost limiting factor in the ability of the organism to engage in strenuous muscular performance. As the working structures demand an uninterrupted supply of the indispensible oxygen, which can reach them only through the blood stream, it becomes apparent that the circulation must have a significant part in maintaining an adequate available quota. Recent experiments by Himwich and Barr leave little doubt that, contrary to what one might expect in times of demand, not only the oxygen capacity but also the oxygen content of the blood is usually augmented during and after short periods of vigorous work. Consequently, no part of the hyperpnea attending ordinary exertion can be attributed to anoxemia—a lack of oxygen in the arterial blood—although after severe and exhausting exercise such a factor may come into play. The mobilization cf red corpuscles with their oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, the stretching of the alveolar membranes through tne more vigorous breathing, and the consequent better diffusion into the lung, all contribute to enable the blood to retain more oxygen. Indeed, the investigations of Himwich and Barr lead them to the unanticipated conclusion that perhaps the severity of the exercise that a normal person will tolerate may be determined by the amount of oxygen that can diffuse through the lung membrane rather than by the capabilities of the circulation.

Collier’s, The National Weekly, has announced a better school program which includes the following points:	(1)	the	right	school

board; (2) unit organization, the superintendent in charge; (3) a sound budget; (4) platoon school buildings and ample playgrounds; (5) a salary schedule that will provide good teachers; (6) studies adapted to present-day needs; (7) abolition of the lock step; C8) project work, to teach cooperation; (9) adequate physical training; (10) junior high schools, with a chance for each child to succeed. Through editorials and accounts of work being done in various parts of the country, Collier’s proposes to do all it can to help the Nation realize this program. Popular education has made possible our great magazines and newspapers. They in turn are more and more lending their efforts to the improvement and extension of education.

I An article in "Physical Education” recently contained the following statements that should interest teachers here in the U.

S. who also think that playing games automatically creates better social beings. In the ariicle spoken of Mr. Naylor says:

It is regularly asserted that Physical Education aims at • influencing the moral life, in addition to building up a sound and symmetrical physique. How easy it is to speak in platitudes, and say that certain forms of exercise inculcate unselfishness, esprit de corps, control confidence, etc., or even to believe this. But are we satisfied that it is so, and do we seek to cultivate these attributes of character when teaching; or do we merely arrange our work on what we consider to be a sound physiological basis and let it remain there?

In a conversation recently with a well-known psychologist he raised points which occur to me to necessitate serious reflection, as to whether the actual exercise or game in itself produces anything of moral value. He agreed that players may exhibit certain desirable dewnMe traits of character when playing, but he also remarked that in those same games players could cheat and do things which were far removed from jthe true spirit of sportsmanship. He also went so far as to say that boys or girls could even play to the lette»> of the laws and still fail4 to acept or act according to the spirit of the game. 1^-1

Defective eyesight in the public schools is costing the taxpayers of the nation at least $130,000,000 annually, it is asserted by the Eye Sight Conservation Council of America.

The Council point out that poor eyesight is responsible for much of the retardation in schools.

Accompanying the statement is a report revealing that heavy moral and financial losses arise from this evil. Approximately 25 per cent of all school children in the United States, the Council finds, are retarded in their studies and fully one-thmd of this retardation is conservatively estimated as due to defective vis'on.

If this is a correct estimate, there are at least, 2,000,000 school children in the United States one or more years behind in their studies because of defective vision.

STRIKING DISEASE AT THE SOURCE

Health ranks pre-eminent among educational ideals; the Commission on Reorganization of Secondary Schools places it first among the seven main objectives of education. Its importance relates not only to school activities but to society as a whole. Neglect of the causes of illness that mean temporary disability and often permanent impairment, either physically or mentally is a major crime against civilization.

For consideration of the subject it is necessary first to inquire into the existing conditions. This is the table of illnesses of childhood, authenticated by many surveys:

Percentage

Colds	32.5

Measles	23.5

Mumps	12.8

Scarlet Fever	7.5

Whooping Cough	4.4

Chicken pox	3.6

Tonsilitis	2.6

Toothache	2.3
Pneumonia	2.3
Diphtheria	.8
Smallpox	.5
Other diseases	7.2
Total	100.00

Immediately this list conveys the conclusion that practically all of these are commmunieable diseases, that their source exists among a few who gradually transmit them to others. It is difficult to curb the original outbreaks but it is less difficult and extremely necessary to prevent the spread of these illnesses.

Consequently, it is essential to strike at the agencies of transmission if this wastage in health and school time is to be prevented. There is a significant coincidence between the list of diseases above given and the facts embodied in Bulletin No. 57 of the United States Public Health Service. In this official document it is stated that common glasses, improperly washed between users, are responsible for the communication of: grippe, influenza, pneumonia, common colds, diphtheria, tonsilitis, measles, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, typhoid fever and infantile paralysis.

The inference is obvious. Recognition of this fact has induced forty-six of the States to banish the common drinking cup in schools. Ban by law and ban by practice—as cu’Tent events indicate—are widely different conditions. However, the law is there and it is the problem of school authorises, for the health of their charges, to insist on its enforcement. Such a duty com-

pels not only observance during school hours but instruction for the protection of children away from this disciplinary influence.

Nor does the bubbler fountain solve the situation. It has been definitely determined now by sanitarians that only a few of these devices guard the children against the infections that are conveyed from the mouth.

It is time for all school authorities to give the most serious thought to the disease menace. Vigilance will safeguard child health and inevitably will reduce the school absence which now is estimated to average six days a year for each pupil.

JJJ'he new physical education law passed by the 40th General Assembly of the Iowa legislature became effective Sept. 1, 1924.

The new law requires that in all such schools there shall be established physical education, including effective health supervision and health instruction, of both sexes, and that every pupil of school age shalj take the prescribed course.

For pupils physically or mentally unable to take the course prescribed for normal children a modified course of instruction has been provided.

Under the law the program of physical education will occupy periods each week totaling not less than fifty minutes, exclusive of recesses.

A regular system of grading has been determined upon and the physical education course will be one of the requirements for graduation and promotion. It is planned to conduct the work out of doors and in the schools. The law does not require erecting a building to carry on the work.~^	1	i

XjDetermined that academics shall not give way to athletics in importance, but realizing the importance of the physical as well as mental development of the student, the Patterson, X. J., board of education’s committee on athletic activities recently announced, following a round table conference in the (itv hall with the principal and physical instructors of the boys’ high school, that it is up to the students to show the proper school spirit by attending the athletic events and supporting the athletes who represent them in the field of sport.

When such a spirit is shown, then, the committee on athletic activities stated, the board of education will consider some plan to give assistance_jn the promotion of athletic activities in the boy’s high school

Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America, on the suggestion of Hugh Frayns, New York City representative of the American Federation of Labor.

The resolution is as follows:

Whereas, In the massing of our population in cities and towns, which will increasingly continue; and in view of the helplessness of children and youths to determine their own environment, and admitting their inherent right to a place in which to play:

BE IT RESOLVED, That the New York State Federation of Labor believes that it is the duty of every community to provide and operate, either by public or private means, adequate space for play and recreation and that at leat ten per cent of the area of a community should be regarded as the minimum requirement for this purpose, so distributed as to give all sections, as nearly as may be, equal accommodation both as to location and area.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, To this end in new city additions of ten acres o’* more this provision should be made a condition of such additions acceptance by the municipalities.

The doctors in Brooklyn, New York are in better general condition than other groups of men in the community, although on the basis of the sample examined, one-third of your membership might well practice "girth control."
