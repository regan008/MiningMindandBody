WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHILD?*

It is “human nature” to overlook faults in our own offspring. Disagreeable statistics on the subject of human imperfections do not impress us much, as we always apply them to other people, but our children are likely to be the average of children the country over. There is no escaping the fact that among 100 children in city, town, or country, about 10 need glasses; it must be taken into account that two or three are more or less hard of hearing, that four or five have no nose so far as use is concerned (and noses are essential for healthy breathing); that five or more have worse than useless tonsils; that 10 of them stoop like an old man, and that at least 50 are the proud possessors of rotting teeth; comparatively few are properly fed, and many are seriously malnourished. We are speaking of the child of school age, but more than half such defects are present before he enters school. Maybe your children do not

belong to the multitude of those needing some correction of defects or of habits, but it is well to make sure and to remain sure.

Health Examination.

Those parents are fortunate who can frequently have the services of a physician who knows about rearing healthy humans as well as about treating sick ones.

A child is infinitely the most complicated as he is the most valuable machine in the world, and it is a simple matter of economy to have him looked over periodically, say on his birthday, to see that he has no loose screws or defective parts, and that he is rightly fueled and oiled, just as one would do with such a -comparative trifle as a $5,000 automobile.

When it comes to health examinations in schools, the parents should be interested to see that the physician is not chosen because he is cheap or needing a job. The salary should be worthy of his position, and should at least equal that of a skilled garage machinist.

It goes without saying that the examination should be thorough and not a mere hasty “looking over” or inspection. This takes time and costs money, but should even an hour or two and the cost of a new hat be considered too much outlay in time and money on such a valuable machine? If the child should need to repeat his year’s work on account of physical disability, it will cost some one from fifty to a hundred dollars, besides the loss of time of teacher and pupil and the vexation of the parent. If we really believe health to be as valuable a thing as we say we do, the physician who directs the health work of the schools should be paid accordingly.

Much of the physical examination of school children can be done with advantage by trained teachers or by nurses under the supervision of the school physician. In fact, the teacher who does not know whether the child under her care sees or hears or breathes or otherwise behaves normally will, at a no distant date, be considered as incompetent and absurd as a seamstress who does not know whether her scissors are sharp, or a professional musician who does not know whether his instrument is in tune. We are no longer attempting in school to direct the progress of bodiless minds.

Is He Growing?

Many fathers are keenly interested in the development of their hens and hogs. They know almost to an ounce whether such livestock are thriving, and they manage their feeding with scientific nicety, but they do not know whether or not their children are runts. Many mothers take pride in the growth of their plants; have a keen eye for signs of drooping or disinclination to bloom, and they sun them or change the soil with the most solicitous care. At the same time the children of the family may be paling and withering under their eyes, and they do not observe anything unusual.

The chief business of the child is to grow, and his healthy growth is of more importance than that of droves of hogs or acres of orchids.

The measuring* and weighing of children have been fundamental features of school health work for the very good reasons that (a) they give us fairly accurate guides as to the child’s rate of growth, and (b) because the child is immensely interested in his measurements, which serve as pegs on which to hang health lessons and establish healthful habits. The height and weight/ of the child at any age depend considerably on heredity, but progress in growth takes place in all. There' is some seasonal variation in growth, and it takes place more rapidly at certain age periods. There may be progress only in height or only in weight for a short season, but neither is at a standstill for long. The school child should be weighed and measured at least every 6 months; the child from 3 to 6 every 3 months and the child from 1 to 3 every 2 months. A child from 3 to 14 who does not gain at least 2 inches in height or 3 1-2 pounds in weight every year is not keeping up with the average, and in some years his increase should be very much greater.

A child who is thin or under the average weight for his height may sometimes be so from hereditary causes, but he should be examined most carefully for defects of body or of habit before deciding that this is a family trait. The child who is excessively fat also deserves special study. We are interested in raising healthy, vigorous children rather than those of standard dimensions, but variations from the average should cause us to make sure they are not abnormal. A child who is free from disease and defect, properly fed, sunned, cleaned, clothed, and exercised (but not over exercised) can be trusted to grow as nature intended.

Is He Well Nourished?

We hear much these days about malnutrition, and it is very common. Just how much of this is due to hereditary tendencies, to omissions and commissions on the part of our ancestors, to racial blunders, and how much is due to faults of feeding in the present generation, including prenatal days, we do not know; but we must begin improvement as best we can in the present, though the immediate results may not be all we could wish. We mean by malnutrition not simply that a child may be undernourished, but that there may not be good stuff in his tissues as indicated by other signs than those of weight; in other words, that he is not healthy. A child may weigh what we should expect him to weigh and yet be badly fed. It has been estimated that one-third of our school children are malnourished, and judging by their teeth the proportion is much higher.

“In a land literally flowing with milk and honey several million children in the public schools suffer from malnutrition,’’ and just as large a proportion of children who have not yet

entered the schools are in like condition. This could hardly be otherwise since "there is good reason to believe that not only the children but all the adults of the country suffer from some degree of dietetic error.”

Faulty food and feeding do not have everything to do with malnutrition, for physical defects may be to blame, and overfatigue and other conditions affect the use of food.

In many schools special work for the undernourished has been carried on. They are told what to eat, given extra meals, and made to rest for certain periods. Not much progress can be made, however, without the help of the home.

AMERICA, A PAGEANT*

By C. Brocar, Director Physical Education, Public Schools, Spokane, Wash.

The following pageant was presented by 6500 pupils of the Spokane Elementary Schools. The Discovery of America, the settlement of the emigrants of one nation after another, the final union of all settlers or immigrants, and the amicable relationship of the many nationalities was the theme. Throughout the pageant there was this theme of happy communion, while in the background the spectators could easily imagine the centuries of wars and tumult oi the European nations from which the participants were supposed to have come. The meaning of the scenes of happiness was focussed upon Columbia, to whom each nation paid homage. Newspaper publicity and final program announcements gave the community and the spectators the fundamental ideas underlying the presentation.

The field was divided into two parts—one representing America—the other Europe. Lines and circles were drawn on the American field to aid pupils in their performances.

As the pupils with their teachers entered the field, their first location was in rear of the American field, directly behind the lines for the mass drill. From here they were directed to assemble in “Europe” under their respective flags.

Each participating school was represented by 32 boys dressed as Indians. These were directed to sit on and around the 35 circles, located on the American field. The children were now organized, and the performance ready to begin. On the American field were 1200 boys seated in circles representing America before the "Coming of the White Mao”. To the east was "Europe” with nations grouped and their children standing under Spanish, Dutch, French, German, Austrian, Swiss, Irish, Scandinavian and Polish flags. The whole scene was in full view of the spectators, and the actors presented a most magnificent spectacle, for practically all the children were in costume.

Part 3

One boy in each circle, representing the chief, majestically walks eight steps forward toward center of circle with arms folded on chest. At the eighth step he raises arms obliquely sideup-ward. At this signal all boys jump to standing position and give Indian yell, with right hand moving before lips. The chief, during this, marks 8 steps in place, then quickly lowers arms when all yelling ceases. The chief now walks back to join the circle. All face right and then each chief leads his group into a maze, out again, and off to the field to their places for mass drill.

As the Indians run off the field, Columbus with officers, sailors, and others appears in background of Spain.

EPISODE 2 The Twelfth of October 1492.

Columbus with companions marches to center of American field. Here a Tableau is formed. The Tableau is an exact duplication of the painting by John Van der Lyn, found in books of history. Columbus has just stepped onto American soil. With the royal banner of Spain in one hand and his sword in the other he is figured as exlaiming “I take possession of this island, which I name San Salvadore, and of all the islands about it, in the name of my patron and sovereign king of Castille.”

During the Tableau the band plays Spanish airs.

Columbus marches off informally with a few Indians who had remained on the field, back to the other half of the stage and disappears.

EPISODE 3 Columbia

Columbia with attendants how appears, and takes possession of an elevated platform that should be erected close to grandstand but in such manner as not to obstruct the view of the field. The platform is decorated with red, white and blue bunting. The band plays “Hail Columbia’’. When the band stops playing, Columbia and attendants take seats.

EPISODE 4

EPISODE 5 Young America at Play

At a given signal, each school ran a group of players onto the field to their respective circles. For about 7 minutes a great variety of games were played. Volleyball nets were tied to window poles, stretched across circles, the poles held by two boys. The band played “Barney Google.” When the band ceased playing all players ran off the field to their places for the mass drill.

All Nations United. One government. One flag. Star Spangled Banner. Salute to the flag.

Mass Drill

The children were now all massed in orderly files, standing directly behind the mass drill lines. In front, of the pupils, 24 American flags were held by 24 flag bearers, standing at proper intervals. The band played “Stars and Stripes Forever”. At a pistol report flag bearers and children advanced to their places on the marked intersections. There were 81 files—80 pupils in each file. Distance between files 3 feet, between ranks 9 feet.

The band thereupon played—“The Star Spangled Banner”. During the playing a huge American flag was carried to Columbia. At a bell signal, given by Columbi3ig^dlj^(&cQQlM^ion of the

A HEALTH OFFICIAL'S VIEW OF THE A. P. H. A. OPEN WINDOW RESOLUTION

It is not often that an old member and ex-president of a society such as the American Public Health Association feels called upon to criticize, instead of defend, its resolutions; but since, at its last meeting, the following resolution, after several preambles was adopted, nothing is left for those who disagree but to indicate it by their protest. The resolution reads:

“Resolved, that the system of ventilating schoolrooms by fresh untreated outdoor air, admitted at the windows, with gravity exhaust ducts for removing vitiated air from near the ceiling is the most generally satisfactory method of school ventilation.

“Be it resolved. that we recommend that State laws and city regulations interfering with such scientific and economical methods of school ventilation should be repealed in the interest of the public health.”

The adoption of the resolution is all the more remarkable since it includes such a crude statement as "the supply of as large an air volume in schoolrooms as 30 cu. ft. per minute per capita is necessarily accompanied with dangerous overheating,” without in any way stating whether it is proposed to pour a similar amount of cold air in by the windows to supply what we suppose is accepted as the required amount, that is, some 2000 cu. ft. per person per hour, and, if so, whether it is to be by one or several windows, whether on the windy or protected side of the room, and at what rate or what is to be the size of the gravity exhaust ducts and their rate of extraction.

The writer prefers to think that some amateur enthusiast, who has been studying English School Reports, in the hurry of business in the Council, “got away” with his resolution without its being fully examined or the effect of its passing being understood.

The writer, therefore, desires to indicate some of the more important facts, which make such a resolution impractical in all northern climates, and especially in Canada.

1.	Assuming that 66 degrees F. is a proper temperature for schoolrooms, offices and houses for all normal persons engaged in sedentary occupations, it is clear that in weather vary-from 32 degrees F. to 20 degrees F. outdoors, as it was here yesterday, making house-warming difficult even with double windows, no open-air system can be tolerated where cold air flows directly in through windows, except in Preventoria, where the children sit dressed in furs with caps, mittens and overshoes.

2.	To al}ow “free untreated air” to enter schoolrooms in cities where soft coal is burned means that desks and books are soon soiled with coal dust, while throats are irritated from its inhalation. Hence some method of filtering the air is neces-

Digitized by CjOO^Ic
18

3.	Since air at zero holds only 0.5 of a grain of water per cubic foot as vapor and air at 70 degrees F. holds 8 grains, it means that the room atmosphere will untreated, air have a relative humidity as low as 25%, with the result that a room temperature of 75 degrees F. will be required owing to excessive loss of body heat through increased evaporation from the skin and mucous membrane.

4.	It must be recognized that all human habitations in cold climates create an artificial climate in which air movements, such as we endure when warmly dressed in moving outer air, are impossible and hence artificial means must be adopted to cope with the changed conditions, and this means mechanical ventilation. Three days ago the writer with a standard air-meter examined some of the chambers in the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, heated from a large central heating plant through steam radiators. The great chamber with a 40.-ft. dome is kept pleasantly warm by a series of inlets for fresh warm air, with corresponding outlets, having a relative humidity constantly of 50% to 55%. So complete is the air distribution in the Senate Chamber that drafts are not noticed by sensitive old men and the room temperature with the proper humidity stands at 67 degrees F.

5.	But to show that only mechanical aids will serve to cope with difficult conditions, the air of the stenographer’s room was tested, where during the sessions of Parliament, 60 persons are busy in a room 80 ft. x 30 ft. x 10 ft. The ventilation of the room consists of four 2 feet square inlets, and an equal number of outlets on an inner wall, which has doors opening on the hall, which is heated from a large inlet a hundred feet away. The ducts were working badly as a door into the hall, as well as four fanlights, were open. These being closed the following result was obtained:

The ducts began delivering air at the rate of 5 ft. a second, pleasantly warm, delivering over 2,000 cu. ft. of washed air p'er hour per capita at a relative humidity of 55%, without drafts except when immediately under the ducts. Within 10 minutes the free movement of fresh air was distinctly noticeable as it was being changed six times an hour. As the floor space gives 40 sq. ft. to each person as compared with 25 sq. ft. in the average for schoolrooms, it is apparent that nothing except a definite, measured amount of air per minute driven into a closed room will serve to supply enough ventilation from hour to hour under such conditions.

6.	At the moment of writing, in his study, while the outer air is—12 degree F. the writer finds the room temperature is 68 degree F. and the relative humidity 55%, due to an automatic humidifier in the warm air furnace, which supplies 1 1-3 gal, of water, as vapor every hour, along with a current of fresh outer air delivered in the flower room through a register to the amount of 10,000 cu. ft. per hour for six persons in a house

" having a cubic air space of 50,000 cu. ft. Owing to the “Law
19

of Diffusion of Gases” this humidity is the same in every room in the house, and always under mechanical control.

7.	It seems needless to multiply examples to illustrate the possibilities of mechanical means to supply fresh, washed, moist air to buildings whether large or small; while experience makes it equally plain that in cold, northern climates such a suggestion as is contained in the resolution is not only chimerical, but indicates that its sponsor and those who adopted it have not made themselves familiar with the factors of the ventilation problem or in any degree solved its difficulties in real cold climates.—

WHAT THE EDUCATED PERSON SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HEALTH

Addressing the American Public Health Association on the above topic at Atlantic City, Dr. Livingston Farrand, President of Cornell University, outlined the following “ten health commandments” with which every intelligent person should be familiar:

1	He should have a knowledge of the physiological basis for sound health habits, such as regular and sufficient_hours of sleep, suitable exercise and proper elimination.

2	He should know the types and amounts and proportions of the various food elements essential to the proper nurture of his body.

3	He should have an acquaintance with the principles of normal mental action and the conditions underlying the more common variations from normal state of mind,-

4	He should have a general understanding of the sex instinct in man—its stages of development, its normal expression and the values and penalties attaching to it.

5	He should have a knowledge of the factors determining infection and resistance and of the principles of artificial immunization in the case of certain of the common infectious diseases.

6	He should have enough knowledge of the causes and prevention of the degenerative diseases to offer a prospect of passing through middle life without a breakdown.

7	He should know and therefore be armed against health hazards linking in the environment, such as polluted water and milk supply, congestion in housing, poisonous dusts of certain industries, infected soil, etc.

8	He should appreciate the necessity for frequent medical and dental examination.

9	He should have an intelligent basis for choosing wisely his medical and dental advisers, and for realizing that the modem practice of medicine is grounded on science.

10	He should have a knowledge of the important health problems facing the community, of the methods of attacking those problems, and of the results to be expected from intelligent community action in the public health fieldiill^^7'rm3’wA; Times.

START THE DAY WITH BREAKFAST*

There is indication of a growing tendency to omit breakfast from the daily routine. As school time again approaches we will find many childreh neglecting breakfast in the rush to get to school on time. Some persons deliberately accustom themselves to do without breakfast in order that they may regularly have a few extra minutes in bed. Adequate sleep is absolutely essential but so also is adequate food. Burning the candle so late at night that getting up in the morning is a task is proof that the system is not getting adequate rest and relaxation. If in addition to inadequate sleep the body is deprived of food in the morning a double injury is done.

Investigation has repeatedly proven that there is a much higher rate of absence from work and from school among those who go without breakfast than among those who regularly eat an appropriate breakfast. There are two factors accounting for this. One is that doing without breakfast decreases efficiency to the extent of inability to go to work. Another explanation is that the person too lazy to get up in time to eat breakfast is so lazy that it requires little excuse to remain away from work. What is even more noticeable is the fact that the great majority of the children who are chronically tardy are the ones who come without breakfast. Those who get up too late to eat breakfast often get up too late to get to school or to work on time. Lack of time is a poor excuse for doing without breakfast, and persons who give this as an excuse had better rearrange their habits and go early enough to bed to get sufficient sleep.

There are, however, many persons who admit doing without breakfast but say it is because they are not hungry. This very often is true. Hunger is nature’s call for building and repair materia] and fuel to produce energy. If, however, the digestive tract is out of order so that food is not properly digested and assimilated then the natural feeling of hunger may be absent. From seven o’clock in the evening until seven o’clock in the morning is twelve hours and this time is much longer than is normally needed to digest food. The healthy person will have an empty stomach in the morning and will be calling for food. Every healthy animal seeks water and food early in the morning.

The person who omits breakfast because he has no appetite needs to give attention to the digestive tract. He is certain to have some trouble there that should be corrected.

With the present fad for “slenderizing” many persons omit breakfast thinking that thus they may reduce. In most cases such persons make up for tnis omission by eating more at the other meals. Instead of reducing the total food intake for the day, it is taken in the one or two heavy meals instead of being distributed in the three or four.

*From North Carolina Health Bulletin.
21

The experience of all time has proven that humanJbeings get along better when the necessary aggregate amount of food is taken in three or four meals at regular hours with equal intervals. During the period of sleep the digestive apparatus may rest and that interval may be longest.

The glands secreting digestive fluids cannot perform this function if they do not have an abundant blood supply furnished them from which to get it. During the digestion of a hearty meal the intestinal and gastric blood vessels are dilated for the purpose of admitting this abundant blood flow to the digestive glands. If, after a hearty meal, one engages in violent exercise which demands an abundant blood flow to the muscles to supply that need then this blood is taken away from the intestinal and gastric glands. With a scant blood supply there is scanty secretion of digestive fluids, consequently an impaired digestion. For this reason active mental or physical exercise should be avoided after a hearty meal. It is a matter of common observation that all animals lay down to sleep when the stomach is full and persons feel sleepy in the afternoon when they have eaten a hearty midday meal. The blood being conducted to the digestive glands leaves a minimum amount going to the brain. The result is drowsiness. It is also a fact that the foods which mainly furnish building and repair material require a longer time for digestion, while, generally speaking, the fuel and energy foods are much more quickly digested and assimilated. The logical conclusion, therefore, is that the heavy meals should be after the day’s work is finished when there is time and blood to digest them, and when products of digestion may be utilized for repairing the tissues wasted by the work. The fuel and energy foods should be taken in the morning when fuel and energy are needed for the activities of the day.

To undertake active work without fuel and energy is like trying to run an engine without steam. The person who begins the day’s work without breakfast drags through the day and accomplishes much less than would be possible with an appropriate breakfast.

What is an appropriate beakfast? is then a question which naturally comes to mind. First we must remember that a great amount of liquid is lost by evaporation through the lungs in exhaled breath, and also from the skin surface of the body. Also the secretion of the kidneys fills the bladder reservoir. All of this means that during the night there has been a great drain of liquid from the blood and hence the first need in the morning is for fluids to replenish this loss. An abundance of water in morning supplies this need and at the same time flushes out the stomach carrying with it quickly into the intestines any residue of food debris and digestive fluids, leaving the stomach fresh and clean to begin another day’s function. While drinking water does this, it also stimulates to activity the muscles of the intestinal walls which leads to normal and easy bowel evacuation. With two or three or more glasses of water the first thing in

the morning, the fluid content of the blood and tissues is replenished, the stomach flushed out and the intestines with their accumulated load of waste material and food debris are emptied. The whole system is in good condition for beginning a new day.

After this is -done and fuel and energy foods are to be taken we must consider what the needs will be. This is determined by the activity of the individual and also the time when he will eat his next meal. Mental work uses up energy and fuel at about the same rate as physical work. The person doing hard mental or physical work will need a breakfast supplying much more fuel than the person doing routine work in a factory which requires little physical exertion and a minimum of concentrated study.

For the usual mixed family group where the adults have a moderately sedentary job in mill or factory, the ideal breakfast may consist of fruit, cereal, bread and beverage (children should not have coffee.) Milk is always ideal for both children and adults. This breakfast is easily and quickly prepared and furnishes variety while it supplies the needs of each member of the group. To this may be added occasionally, eggs and bacon and some sweets. Sugar, such as syrup, jam and preserves is a valuable fuel and energy food which is quickly burned up and leaves little to be stored up as fats. Sugars are not fattening but sugar supplies energy and permits the proteins and fats, the building foods, to be stored up as fats. Without the sugars these building foods would, if needed, be used as fuel foods. This gives grounds for the erroneous idea that sugars are fattening.

For the family whose work is very strenuous, either physical or mental, a somewhat heavier breakfast may be necessary. To the above articles may be added some meat and potatoes, or fish.

Except by the direction of a doctor for some specific reason, breakfast should never be omitted. “Well begun is half done,” and the day started right with an appropriate breakfast .will end with a consciousness of having more easily attained success.

PHYSICAL TRAINING IN NEW ZEALAND

By Miss Ruth Jarvis, M. B. A. P. T.

Government Schools.—The countiy is divided into counties as in England, with two or three inspecting instructors (organisers) who have anything from 600 to 800 in their county.

Each teacher takes her own class for physical training each day for fifteen minutes and receives one or two visits per year from the instructors, the first visit being monthly, one of the instructors teaching, the second visit mainly inspection.

The house system has not yet been introduced into the State schools, though the secondary schools adopt this method for prganised_ games. In the private schools, net ball is taught,

23

but in secondary schools basket ball is the game played, and very keenly contested in inter-school matches. The training colleges have their own games organisations, and visit each other to contest for the shield, playing football (boys) basket ball, boxing (boys) swimming ana tennis. Tennis is just as popular in the Dominion as in England, children being taught the game from the age of twelve or thirteen.

Secondary Schools and Colleges mostly have their own physical training instructor. The day of the uncertificated teacher in this subject is growing less every year, though there is still not enough qualified instructors, owing to the fact that New Zealand has not awakened to the necessity of physical training, and the salaries offered are inadequate to tempt trained teachers to New Zealand.

Adult Evening Classes.—These are largely conducted by Y. M. C. A.’s and Y. W. C. A.'s. although there are a few private teachers who take the ordinary subjects of physical training, including medical gymnastics.

Public Games.—For men there is no rival to Rugby football, which is most popular throughout the country, the boys starting from infancy, when they learn to kick the ground in lieu of a ball and continue to play until they are too old to play any longer.

For Girls and Women basket ball and hockey have equal claims. A few years ago, a Basket Ball Association was formed in the large cities, and this year inter-provincial games are coming into force and showing the superiority of basket ball over hockey.

Swimming is more popular in the northern towns, where the weather and water is warmer. Further south there are tepid baths, where the school children go once a week for six months of the year. Progress much depends upon the teacher in charge, but instruction is liable to be haphazard. The general public indulge in swimming more in the summer time, and most towns hold a swimming carnival once a year, which is moderately well attended. Interest in this fine form of recreation, is, however, slowly increasing.

Eurythmics.—We are fortunate in having in Christchurch the first teacher of eurythmics, who came to the Dominion to stay here, and as the work is proving popular we hope in time that every centre will have its teacher of eurythmics.

National and character dancing of various descriptions has a place in the public's favour, particularly Scotch dances in the South Island. No one has yet taken up folk dancing seriously, with the exception of myself and Miss Greenwood, the physical instructress. for the Canterbury district, who has just returned from a visit to England and is introducing it into the primary council schools.

THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF HEALTH EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION VIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL.

The present confusion in terminology in health education and physical education is unnecessary, wasteful, and injurious to the profession. It is due largely to misunderstanding of the nature of health, the real scope of health work, and the unique, characteristic and essential function of physical education.

It is important to observe that health education and physical • education are not identical, that one does not include the other.* The combined term health and physical education should be employed whenever there is a closely organized plan for the two fields. It is proposed that health is not a measurable thing, not merely physical, not mass but function, not an end but only a means. It is held therefore that health education should be concerned with health supervision, health service, and health instruction, and that physical education should center its efforts on a four-fold development of the individual: (1) development of organic systems, (2) development of neuro-muscular mechanisms, (3) development of fundamental activities in relation to play, recreation, and leisure time use, and (4) development of social and moral qualities.

Education does not take place in water-tight compartments. Physical education if wisely led and intelligently supervised will contribute to health. Biology, physiology, sociology, history, chemistry, and other subjects also contribute to health. Their unique, characteristic, and essential purpose precludes calling them health education. So it is with physical education.

Let us not think of physical education as a therapeutic, rehabilitating, corrective, hospitalized procedure but rather as a great educational agency in which the word physical connotes the means through which a four-fold development is to occur.

Jessie Feiring Williams,

Teachers College, Columbia University,

New York, January 1927.

Note:-This short article by Dr. Jesse F. Williams might be read with profit by those teachers, supervisors and directors who recently were caught in the health education movement, and who thought that they best could show their interest in health by dropping the term physical education.—Editor.

SWIMMING

Dr. Elliot said “The most important issue today is physical education.” Swimming is an essential physical training activity. The term “High School Education” should not apply to anyone who has not mastered the rudiments of swimming and of life saving.	Digitized by ^ Google

The need of bringing the “Old Swimming Hole/’ in the form of artificial pools, back to the community is apparent. When communities expand and the swimming hole, the canal and the mill creek are gone it is absolutely necessary for some unit of government to fill the gap and provide substitutes. In recent years school as well as park boards are coming to the rescue. “Goin’ swimming” in creeks and rivers is like the old gray mare of the popular song. “It ain’t what it used to be”. The Ohio State Health department says: “Watch your step. Discharge of sewage into streams makes them dangerous”. It is safer to swim in a well supervised pool than in most creeks and small rivers.

To the uninitiated most swimming statements sound like patent medicine ads.—but tiy a swim the next time you don't quite feel right. Then, again, most people do not realize that the blind and deaf, the one legged or one armed persons, the paralytic, those who use crutches, that all of these get comfort and enjoyment through swimming.

The therapeutic value of swimming has long been recognized, but it has not yet been sufficiently embodied in a program of individual corrective work. This is due probably to the insufficient training of many swimming teachers. This however, is gradually being overcome, as for instance in the appointment, here in Cincinnati, of none but accredited Normal School graduates, as swimming teachers for High School functions. The swimming teacher should be able to carry out a program to educate Hie public to recognize that swimming and life saving is of vital importance to society. He should also be competent to create within the entire student body a love for cleanliness. He should be able to make the pool and its surroundings conform to the best standards of hygiene and sanitation.

When children have once acquired the habits of personal cleanliness, their thoughts go out to their own rooms and homes.

A little New York boy of the slums said: "Swimming is the only sport you come clean from”. Swimming is fast becoming our most popular sport, but unfortunately, in many cases, a a very hazardous one. Your duty to yourself demands that you should know something about swimming and that furthermore you should acquire the ability to remain for at least a brief period under water.

It is unwise to advocate one method of instruction for all because of the physiological and psychological difference in men, women and children. Adapt the stroke to the individual and not the individual to the stroke (Sheffield). Or do you prefer the method so often advocated by the thoughtless: “I learned to swim when my big brother threw me in deep water and told me to swim or sink” or A man walking on the river bank heard the cry "Help, I can not swim” and answered back “Now, if ever, is your time to learn,” “Sink or Swim” “Swim or no sheepskin” recently were headlines of articles appearing in the press, stating that higher educational institutescwiW? Istrictly en-

force the requirement of being able to swim and know something of Life Saving, before students will be allowed to graduate.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON OTO-RHINOLOGIC HYGIENE OF SWIMMING*

The healthfulness of swimming as an exercise is undeniable, but the human body lacks adaptation to sojourn in water, and means for its protection are, therefore, necessary.

Public health authorities, in most of the states, have promulgated adequate rules for the construction, maintenance and bacteriologic examination of swimming pools and bathing places.

In certain states, notices are now suggested or prescribed, “warning persons with colds, head infections, running noses or ears or catarrh, that swimming or diving tends to force infection into the sinuses or ears, resulting in serious, if not fatal, consequences.” The use of such notices should be suggested to the public health authorities of all the states.

It is suggested that oiled wool or other effective methods of closing the external auditory meatus (ear) be advised, in order to prevent external otitis.

It is further suggested that improper swimming or diving habits (such as inbreathing when the head is more or less submerged; diving feet first with nostrils open: blowing the nose, coughing or hawking into the tank), should be forbidden by public health authorities.

Research has disclosed rapid lowering of body temperature and hence of resistance to infection, both from immersion and from exposure of the body in wet bathing suits; it is therefore suggested that a time limit of from forty-five minutes to one hour be placed on use of a pool by each bather in order that:

1	The number of bathers at any given time (bathing load) may be reduced.

2	The loss of body heat due to chilling may be minimized.

It is further suggested that the Bureau on Health and

Public Instruction, and the editors of Hygeia be advised of these recommendations and requested to cooperate with a committee of this section in the preparation of standard posters, notices and articles on the proper technic of swimming and diving, including breathing habits; methods of getting rid of water; methods of keeping water out of the ears and nose; physical effects of exposure and immersion in normal adults and children, and the relation of swimming and diving to recurrent colds, chronic accessory sinus disease, otitis and deafness.

In this connection the services of noted experts, both teachers and record holders in these valuable sports, should be secured.

Respectfully submitted.	H. M. Taylor, Chairman

Approved Form Of Notice

In order to maintain proper standards and protect the health of patrons, it is necessary to insist on observation of the following rules, which are approved and their strict enforcement

required by the------------- State	Board of Health: Warning:

Persons with colds, head infections, “running noses or ears," catarrh, are warned that swimming, diving, etc., tend to force the infection into the sinuses or ears, and result in serious if not fatal complications.

1	All bathers shall use shower baths, including soap, if necessary, before entering the plunge. (The plunge is not intended as a bath tub.)

2	Bathers who have been outside the bath house or plunge enclosure shall not reenter without passing through a foot bath and using a shower.

3	Bathers shall be forbidden to wear private bathing suits that are not properly laundered; light colored or undyed wool is suggested.

4	Women shall wear caps while in plunge.

5	Persons not dressed for bathing shall not be allowed on walks surrounding plunge, and bathers shall not be allowed in places provided for spectators.

6	No person suffering from a fever, cold, cough, or inflamed eyes shall be allowed the use of the plunge. (These disorders may be transmitted to others.)

7	No person with sores or other evidence of skin disease, or who is wearing a bandage of any kind, shall be allowed the use of the plunge. (A bandage may conceal a source of infection.)

8	Spitting in, or in any other way contaminating, the plunge, and spirting on floors, runway, aisles or dressing rooms shall be prohibited.

9	Public combs or brushes shall not be furnished, and such articles left by bathers shall be permanently removed.

10	Eating within the plunge enclosure shall be prohibited.

11	Bringing or throwing into the plunge any objects that may in any way carry contamination, endanger safety of bathers, or produce unsightliness, shall be prohibited.

The majority of our patrons will observe these rules of their own accord and will render us a great service by reporting any infractions to the attendants. Any person failing to comply with the foregoing rules will be immediately expelled and denied the future privileges of the bath house.

Rules For Sanitation And Safety Of Swimming Pools

1	All swimming pools are to be maintained with a practical minimum amount of contamination. There shall be not more than 1,000 colonies per cubic centimeter of standard agar medium after incubating for twenty-four hours at 37F. The B. coli content shall be such that gas is produced in not more than one and a half of standard lactic broth cultures after incubation for twenty-four hours with 1 cc. of water.

2	Water in the pool shall at all times of use be sufficiently transparent, under existing lighting conditions, that when the water surface is not excessively agitated by bathers, a person can stand at the side of the pool and see the bottom distinctly where the depth of water is 6 feet or less.

3	Facilities for adequate protection of the pool water against unnecessary sputum contamination by bathers shall be provided.

4	All persons known to be or suspected of being affected with infectious diseases shall be excluded from the pool.

5	Contamination of the pool resulting from lack of personal cleanliness of bathers shall be maintained at a minimum.

6	Construction and appliances shall be such as to reduce to a practical minimum the danger of drowning and of injury to bathers from falls or collisions.

7	Dressing rooms, hallways, toilet rooms, shower rooms and other places to which patrons of a bath house have access shall be kept clean and well ventilated at all times.

8	Bathing suits and towels, when distributed to bathers by the pool management, shall be clean and free from excessive bacterial contamination.

9	The management of the pool shall have printed and posted in conspicuous places about the establishment notices briefly informing patrons of the requirements to which they are subject in the maintenance of a safe and sanitary pool. A form of notice is suggested to pool operators; it should be so placed that all bathers cannot fail to read it before entering the pool.

SAVE THE SCHOOL CHILDREN

“Too much education” appears to be the verdict of Prof. P. M. Lelean, recently appointed to the chair of public health in the University of Edinburgh, who devoted his inaugural address to a discussion of the effect of our school training on the health of children. Says The British Medical Journal (London) in an abstract of Professor Lelean’s conclusions:

“Professor Lelean began by saying that in taking his bearings for a future course in public health he had turned to the lessons of the great war, which had forced us to take stock of our available man power and to classify men of military age.

It was found that out of every nine men of military age in Great Britain on the average three were fit, two were on a definitely infirm plane of health, three could almost be described as physical wrecks, and the remaining man was a chronic invalid with a precarious hold on life. That revelation had been a shock to national complacency, and had resulted in an outburst of remedial energy. This had included maternity and child welfare work, to which already the nation owed much. It was only necessary to watch a stream of workers at the close of a working day, or other crowds of people, to realize the extent to which the nation was still C3. It was not possible to unmake C3's. but an endeavor could be made to place expectant mothers and growing children under conditions so favorable that the next generation might be Al. It was a bad doctrine for the race that 95 per cent of available funds should be spent in tinkering with a C3-ridden generation, while only 5 per cent was expended upon the evolution of a new generation so fit that it would defy disease. When the war broke out it had been firmly believed that no soldier could be trained in less than twelve months, but at the end of the war the men were being sent to the front as useful infantrymen in less than two months, while the German training period fell to one month. It was of the utmost importance for the future of the nation that this lesson, the force of which was already waning, should be revived. Professor Lelean believed that some of the younger children were being prest beyond their mental powers, while of the older children a large proportion were being very seriously overworked. Children’s working hours often mounted up to ten. hours a day. The result of what he described as a pernicious system was that toward the end of every term children were pallid, irritable, ‘temperamental/ and obviously played out, and parents watched them with growing anxiety lest they should break down before the holidays came. At the end of their school life they came to the higher educational centers like saturated sponges. It had been said by a recent authority that examinations were ruining the intelligence of the nation for all practical purposes. He thought a ‘Save the Children League’ might do good work nearer home than in the Near East. He suggested that the support of parents might be gained for a three-plank platform: (1) to get 30 per cent knocked off every examination standard and every secondary education curriculum in the country; (2) to insure that the amount of homework was adequately supervised; (3) to secure for some physiological expert a seat on every educational committee in the country. The family doctor, social worker, and district nurse needed to be conversant with all factors affecting the maternal, industrial, and communal efficiency of the family—the feeding budget, clothing problem, light and fuel bills, recreation facilities, and mental needs.”

CAN YOU USE $2,000 FOR PLAY SPACE?

This is a bona fide offer by the Harmon Foundation to make twenty-three $2,000 donations toward the purchase of playgrounds this year. The Foundation wishes to bring the playgrounds which it has helped to secure to a total of one hundred. The new offer will just accomplish this, as seventy-seven recreation fields have already been secured in thirty states.

The awards will be administered by the Playground and Recreation Association of America 315 Fourth Ave., New York, to which all Requests for application forms and full information should be addressed. In brief, the terms are as follows:

Selection of the successful communities will be made upon individual merit in the order their claims are presented. The offer is not competitive.

To be considered for an award, a community must show a growth of 30% or more since 1900. Each town must have a permanent population of 2,500 or more at present. Rapidly growing suburbs where there are 2,500 or more within a radius of one mile of the proposed playground may apply. Two acres will be the minimum land area considered. Each site must be within play distance of the residence section by which it is to be used.

Two thousand dollars is the maximum gift for each play field on the part of the Harmon Foundation, but there is no reason why this should not form part of a larger purchase if the full balance of the excess cost is provided in advance and the other conditions of the offer are satisfactorily met. Not more than one contribution is made to any community. Towns or cities already provided with play fields secured through the assistance of the Harmon Foundation are not eligible for this offer.

In this award it is the case of “first come, first served”; that is, if your community qualifies. Therefore, it is suggested that communities apply promptly.

PRAYER OF A SPORTSMAN

By Berton Braley

Dear Lord, in the battle that goes on through life I ask but a field that is fair,

A chance that is equal with all in the strife A courage to strive and to dare;

And if I should win, let it be my code

With my faith and my honor held high;

And if I should lose, let me stand by the road And cheer as the winners go by!

And, Lord, may my shouts be ungrudging and clear,

A tribute that comes from the heart.

And let me not cherish a snarl or a sneer Or play any sniveling part;

Let me say, “There they ride on whom laurel’s bestowed Since they played the game better than I,”

Let me stand with a smile by the side of the road And cheers as the winners go by!

So grant me to conquer, if conquer I can By proving my worth in the fray;

But teach me to lose like a Regular Man And not like a craven, I pray.

Let me take off my hat to the warriors who strode To victory splendid and high Yes, teach me to stand by the side of the road And cheer as the winners go by!

persons on whose hands rests the physical and moral education of their respective populations, in finding adequate Playing Fields for those who desire to play, the International Olympic Committee assembled here in Conference in Lisbon, desires to draw the attention of every Government to the necessity of giving their immediate attention to the provision of Open Spaces, Playing Fields, Playgrounds for Children, in every city, town and village in their respective countries. Further, the International Olympic Committee draws the attention of all the National Olympic Committees to the necessity of organizing in collaboration with their Governing Bodies of Sport a special organization, which shall devote itself entirely to the study of this vitally important question.”

BEAUTY AND POPULARITY

In all the realm of nature there were never two objects exactly alike. Each blade of grass, each tree and each human being has some peculiarity all its own. Nature abhors monotony and hence makes no two alike. She makes them so nearly alike there is a family resemblance but always there is a difference. When individuality becomes extreme it then becomes a freak, and while nature abhors “sameness” she also abhors freakishness. Physical beauty is a blending of colors and shapes typifying our ideal average for that family of objects or individuals. The beautiful girl is one who is neither fat nor skinny, whose nose is neither long nor flat, whose mouth is neither large or small, who has, in fact, no freakish feature or expression.

The ugly man, woman or child is the one who WE think has a nose too big, a mouth too little, eyes the wrong color and hair that does not match. But after all who are we to decide this matter? Dare we say the maid from Timbuctoo is less handsome or less perfect than the maid who won our bathing beauty contest? The standard is the ideal average for that family of objects or individuals. So, too, in the realm of character or disposition we love most the one who is most balanced. The person who shows some outstanding trait or mannerism is odd. The odd person does not mix well in the association with others.

All outstanding individual traits or characteristics are the result of environment or habit. There was at first an individual characteristic which environmental conditions developed or permitted to grow until it became a freakish characteristic. A good illustration of this is the criminal who disregards the rights of others—who robs and commits murder, because as a child the trait of selfishness, common to all persons, was allowed to develop to an extreme, because as an only child doting parents gave in to every whim and wish. So firmly fixed has become the habit of thinking first of self that in later life selfishness overpowers all other considerations.	Digitized	by	Goo

The little girl who pouts and bites her nails will, if untaught, go on biting her nails and develop other unpleasant mannerisms which will make of her “persona non grata” among her fellows and- interfere with her usefulness in life.

During the plastic period of childhood and adolescence these “lopsided# freakish traits should be pruned off while yet they are only buds. At this age the operation of pruning produces little pain and no damage. The ideal to keep in mind is maturity which embodies to the greatest possible degree the ideal average.

A tang of individuality, like a grain of salt is charming. Individuality permitted to develop into extreme freakishness is also like salt in excess which causes a dead sea of briny uselessness and isolation.—N. Carolina Health Bulletin.

The U. S. Public Health Service, Washington, D. C., issues “exhibits,” consisting of colored posters, on the subject of sex hygiene, which they are willing to loan to any school. They are accompanied by suggestions for their presentation before a class.

Dr. E. H. Arnold, from his studies by means of the X-ray of the spines of young persons of college age concludes that bad posture is often the result of bony deformities, and that no amount of “corrective” exercises will produce much effect in such cases.

In a study made by Dr. E. Thos. Beggs, School Medical Officer, Borough of Middleton, England, of 272 retarded children 7 to 14 years of age chronologically and 4 to 12 years by the Sherman-Binet test, there were found to be four times as many cases per 100 of malnutrition, of defective vision, of ear disease, and defective hearing, • as appeared in the routine examination of average school children of these ages. There was evidence of rickets in six times as many retarded children, and defective speech was 16 times more common.

Although the cause of “second breath” is far from being explained, recent studies in the Department of Physiology of the University of Pennsylvania show that the condition appears earlier the warmer the. room, the more clothing worn, and the heavier the work. This is interpreted as meaning that the muscles rid themselves of products of activity with ease only when they have reached high temperature, though this far from explains the nature of “second breath”.

Report Of The Superintendent Of The Public Schools

Of Cleveland

Most of this report of 138 pages is devoted to methods and practices in character education and in health education. The part devoted to character education is very good and should show others who are looking for guidance in this branch of education how to proceed. The part of the report devoted to health education also is of value, although it would be interesting to teachers of physical education to see how in Cleveland, physical education and athletics are definitely connected with health education.

The price of the report is $1.25 for which it'can be obtained from the Division of Publications, Board Pf Educatlor^ Cleveland.

October 3rd through the 7th, 1927 is the date of the next Recreation Congress which will be held in Memphis, Tenn.

The earlier date has been chosen this year because of requests from a number of recreation workers who feel that this earlier time will interfere less with their regular programs.

“Posture and Poise’’ by Dr. Sargent, which appeared in a recent edition of Mind and Body, was certainly well worth reprinting and I, for one, found a lot of food for thought therein. Are we not all of us apt to be faddists more or less at times? I well remember my father’s words “If they had stuck to gymnastics as it has been taught for years and years, there would be no need of this hue and cry of posture.” After all, what is “posture training” if not gymnastics? The Germans and the Swedes had the same objectives in mind—to develop harmony and perfect control of the body and to make for better citizenship.

The ideals and work of our pioneers, whether they were American, German or Swedish, have stood that test. Possibly with a few minor changes in detail their work is as good today as years ago.

I don’t want to appear old-fashioned. In fact, I’m far from it. We have classes in posture training and frequently I am called upon to give talks on Posture, but the subject is the same, only camouflaged.

The evolution of gymnastics will be, I hope, a union of German and Swedish with the resultant offspring “Rational Gymnastics.”

Now we have Danish! I, for one, don’t believe that Danish is adaptable for school children. We teach it in our school and the students like it. I like it myself, but it will have to be modified quite a good deal before it can be taught to school children.

In closing may I make this plea: don’t discard the old until it has been found wanting and don’t rush headlong into something new. Be sure it proves its worth before adopting it.

Increasing the weight of its hurdles from 16 to 24 pounds, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association at it annual meeting in New York, March 5th abolished a rule calling for a disqualification of athletes who kick over three or more of the barriers in their flight. In the future, hurdlers will be able to flatten out every standard in the route without fear of punishment.

Officials contended that faulty hurdling is in itself a sufficient penalty, having a tendency to throw the contestant out of stride. By the same reasoning, the association voted to abolish the one yard penalty for one false hurdle start.

Claiming that the old requirement setting back the "gun-beater” a yard imposes too great a handicap,'voted
45

to disregard first offenses and to disqualify altogether for a second offense in hurdling.

A scale of penalties for premature starts in flat racing was established, superseding the former uniform 1-yard penalty for all distances. Hereafter punishment will be meted out as follows: 50 yards or less, 1 foot; over 50 to 75 yards, 2 feet; over 75 to 440 yards, 1 yard; over 440 yards, 3 yards, the penalty will be repeated for a second offense, and a third premature start will result in disqualification.

The University of Bologna, Italy, has established a school of physical education in connection with its department of medicine. The school will give a two year course, and not only medical students but those in other departments will be accepted. The professor of hygiene in the University will direct the new school. This event is most significant, for we believe this University is the first to dignify the subject of physical education by placing it in its department of medicine.

Dr. H. Corry Mann, who has been conducting a four-years study in nutrition, for the medical research council of England, found that a pint of milk a day added to a milk-free, but appetite satisfying, diet of boys, increased the average annual gain in weight over 3 pounds, and the average increase in height 3-4 of an inch. The effect was proven to be due not to the relatively small fuel increase nor to extra protein, but to more specific food qualities of the milk. There was accompanying improved general health and “spirit”.

Some Fundamental Features of the Circulation. During exercise, respiration may increase eight or ten. fold, and the circulation four or five fold. It is estimated that the maximum power of the heart is about equal to the amount of work involved in lifting the weight of the body one meter per minute.

Certain incidental observations of the circulation are of clinical interest. Hot baths quicken circulation without greatly increasing the oxygen consumption. In this way they reduce the “oxygen difference” and thus raise the pressure of oxygen in the tissues. During vigorous exercise, the increase in the circulation may not keep pace with the oxygen consumption, so that the oxygen difference increases because the circulation does not. In patients with heart disease, the inefficiency of the circulation may show itself in the increase of the arteriovenous oxygen difference above the normal value. Hence, Henderson and Haggard point out, the capacity of the circulation to keep the oxygen difference down, and thus to keep the oxygen pressure in the tissues up, appears to be the limiting factor in the maximum power that can be sustained by athletes at one end of the scale, and by patients with heart disease at the other.

“Physical Education for Primary Schools.” In formal Gysmastics in Lesson Form with Piano Accompaniment. By W. A. Ocker. Cloth bound, 11 1-2 x 8 1-2”, 83 pages. Price $2.00. Published by A. S. Barnes and Company, New York.

The name of the book is rather misleading for upon examination we find that the lessons outlined are for first and second grades only. Perhaps the author hesitated to add another book on “singing games” to the market. But the work of the first and second grades as outlined is in the form of singing games, action stories and gymnasium games.

Each of the singing games has piano accompaniment and description that is easy to follow. The selection is good and varied, though perhaps there is a lack of vigorous action that is desirable even with young children. A number of these games are adapted nursery rhymes already familiar and liked by children.

The picture stories suggested provide good material for this very excellent form of imitative activity.

This book can be used to advantage by any teacher of the lower grades.—Janet B. Walter.

“Calisthenics,” by S. C. Staley. Modern Methods of Free-Exercise Instruction.

Published by A. S. Barnes and Company. Cloth bound, 338 pp. Price $3.00.

This most recent book by Mr. Staley presents a rather broad consideration of calisthenics. It includes discussions on the purpose and function of calisthenics, the principles of nomenclature formation, calisthenic nomenclature, methods of exercising, principles of lesson formation, the lesson plan, programs and model lessons for nomal groups, the technique of teaching, a critical analysis of representative lessons, and a rather meager bibliography. It contains a liberal number of illustrations which

leave no doubt in the reader’s mind as to what the author is talking about.

Students in normal schools and teachers in the field who have had little or no training can find much to augment their knowledge and teaching technique by a study of this book.

Unfortunately the author has permitted his personal opinions and his own rather circumscribed experience to dictate much of the material of the book. This fact will undoubtedly militate against its extensive use by normal schools.

One reads with considerable astonishment the author’s statement that in a review of the literature of physical education: “To my surprise I found almost nothing on the subject.” Can it be that he missed the several good treatises by American authors, and the wealth of material printed by the Germans, Danes and Swedes? To judge by the references and quotations found in his book, the author has been unduly influenced by but a few people.

In his discussion of calisthenic nomenclature, Mr. Staley deprecates the fact that “Every book on the subject has a separate individual set of terms.” We are in hearty accord with him in his plea for a universal nomenclature. But we lift our hands in alarm and protest when, shortly after, we note his attempts to introduce still another ‘best’ nomenclature. It seems to us that instead of simplifying the matter, as he feels his nomenclature does, he complicates it still further. For example, Mr. Staley gives specific names to all of his exercises. Some of these are: “Chesty Charlie,” “The Salaam,” “The Collegians Delight,” “The Grinder,” “The Wind Jammer,” “The Ground Hog,” and the like.

Furthermore, we believe there are but few teachers who will agree that the command “Place” should be used as the command of execution for all exercises; or what the word “Stop” should be adopted exclusively as the command for stopping the exercise. It would seem to us that such a practice is carrying the process of simplification altogether too far. The author claims that both class and teacher soon become accustomed to these words. This may be true but we find it difficult to agree that a command such as, for example, “Feet apart—Place!” —as used by Staley—can ever become as suggestive, and therefore as good, as “Jump to a side-stride stand—Jump!”

Of the other bits of nomenclature which may with good reason be objected to, the following only are cited: The use in the word ‘hands’ instead of ‘arms’; ‘bend the head backward’ ofstead of ‘lower the head backward’ or‘bend the neck backward’ and ‘hands in front of chest’ instead of ‘hands in front of shoulders'.

The reviewer, in conclusion, wishes to express the hope that his remarks will not be construed as a condemnation of this book. On the whole it is good; the viewpoints reflected therein are especially sane. For the two classes of readers referred to above, it should be of considerable valq^—pj^eroWjcMueller
